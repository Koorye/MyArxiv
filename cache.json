However, in practice,\ntransformers' reasoning can be improved by allowing them to use a \"chain of\nthought\" or \"scratchpad\", i.e., generate and condition on a sequence of\nintermediate tokens before answering. Motivated by this, we ask: Does such\nintermediate generation fundamentally extend the computational power of a\ndecoder-only transformer? We show that the answer is yes, but the amount of\nincrease depends crucially on the amount of intermediate generation. For\ninstance, we find that transformer decoders with a logarithmic number of\ndecoding steps (w.r.t. the input length) push the limits of standard\ntransformers only slightly, while a linear number of decoding steps, assuming a\nslight generalization to standard pre-norm, adds a clear new ability (under\nstandard complexity conjectures): recognizing all regular languages. Our\nresults also imply that linear steps keep transformer decoders within\ncontext-sensitive languages, and polynomial steps with generalized pre-norm\nmake them recognize exactly the class of polynomial-time solvable problems --\nthe first exact characterization of a type of transformers in terms of standard\ncomplexity classes.

In this paper, we introduce RoleInteract,\nthe first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the sociality of\nrole-playing conversational agents at both individual and group levels of\nsocial interactions. The benchmark is constructed from a variety of sources and\ncovers a wide range of 500 characters and over 6,000 question prompts and\n30,800 multi-turn role-playing utterances. We conduct comprehensive evaluations\non this benchmark using mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs. We find\nthat agents excelling in individual level does not imply their proficiency in\ngroup level. Moreover, the behavior of individuals may drift as a result of the\ninfluence exerted by other agents within the group. Experimental results on\nRoleInteract confirm its significance as a testbed for assessing the social\ninteraction of role-playing conversational agents.

It is a typical example that the model knows \"A's father is\nB\", but is unable to reason \"B's child is A\". This limitation poses a challenge\nto the advancement of artificial general intelligence (AGI), as it suggests a\ngap in the models' ability to comprehend and apply bidirectional reasoning. In\nthis paper, we first conduct substantial evaluation and identify that the root\ncause of the reversal curse lies in the different word order between the\ntraining and inference stage, namely, the poor ability of causal language\nmodels to predict antecedent words within the training data. Accordingly,\npermutation on the training data is considered as a potential solution, since\nthis can make the model predict antecedent words or tokens. However, previous\npermutation methods may disrupt complete phrases or entities, thereby posing\nchallenges for the model to comprehend and learn from training data. To address\nthis issue, we propose Semantic-aware Permutation Training (SPT), which\naddresses this issue by segmenting the training sentences into semantic units\n(i.e., entities or phrases) with an assistant language model and permuting\nthese units before feeding into the model.

Recent advances in sequence modeling have sparked\ninterest in learning user embeddings from behavioral data. Yet behavior-based\nuser embedding learning faces the unique challenge of dynamic user modeling. As\nusers continuously interact with the apps, user embeddings should be\nperiodically updated to account for users' recent and long-term behavior\npatterns. Existing methods highly rely on stateless sequence models that lack\nmemory of historical behavior. They have to either discard historical data and\nuse only the most recent data or reprocess the old and new data jointly. Both\ncases incur substantial computational overhead. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce User Stateful Embedding (USE). USE generates user embeddings and\nreflects users' evolving behaviors without the need for exhaustive reprocessing\nby storing previous model states and revisiting them in the future.\nFurthermore, we introduce a novel training objective named future W-behavior\nprediction to transcend the limitations of next-token prediction by forecasting\na broader horizon of upcoming user behaviors.

However,\nour analysis also suggests that there is no statistical reason that pretraining\nwill lead to hallucination on facts that tend to appear more than once in the\ntraining data (like references to publications such as articles and books,\nwhose hallucinations have been particularly notable and problematic) or on\nsystematic facts (like arithmetic calculations). Therefore, different\narchitectures and learning algorithms may mitigate these latter types of\nhallucinations.\n","authors":["Adam Tauman Kalai","Santosh S.

To train TSMMG, we construct a large set of\ntext-molecule pairs by extracting molecular knowledge from these 'teachers',\nenabling it to generate novel molecules that conform to the descriptions\nthrough various text prompts. We experimentally show that TSMMG remarkably\nperforms in generating molecules meeting complex, natural language-described\nproperty requirements across two-, three-, and four-constraint tasks, with an\naverage molecular validity of over 99% and success ratio of 88.08%, 65.27%, and\n61.44%, respectively. The model also exhibits adaptability through zero-shot\ntesting, creating molecules that satisfy combinations of properties that have\nnot been encountered. It can comprehend text inputs with various language\nstyles, extending beyond the confines of outlined prompts, as confirmed through\nempirical validation. Additionally, the knowledge distillation feature of TSMMG\ncontributes to the continuous enhancement of small models, while the innovative\napproach to dataset construction effectively addresses the issues of data\nscarcity and quality, which positions TSMMG as a promising tool in the domains\nof drug discovery and materials science.

To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel\ninference method, Prompt Highlighter, which enables users to highlight specific\nprompt spans to interactively control the focus during generation. Motivated by\nthe classifier-free diffusion guidance, we form regular and unconditional\ncontext pairs based on highlighted tokens, demonstrating that the\nautoregressive generation in models can be guided in a classifier-free way.\nNotably, we find that, during inference, guiding the models with highlighted\ntokens through the attention weights leads to more desired outputs.

The Misleading Success of\n  Simulating Social Interactions With LLMs","summary":"  Recent advances in large language models (LLM) have enabled richer social\nsimulations, allowing for the study of various social phenomena with LLM-based\nagents. However, most work has used an omniscient perspective on these\nsimulations (e.g., single LLM to generate all interlocutors), which is\nfundamentally at odds with the non-omniscient, information asymmetric\ninteractions that humans have. To examine these differences, we develop an\nevaluation framework to simulate social interactions with LLMs in various\nsettings (omniscient, non-omniscient). Our experiments show that interlocutors\nsimulated omnisciently are much more successful at accomplishing social goals\ncompared to non-omniscient agents, despite the latter being the more realistic\nsetting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that learning from omniscient simulations\nimproves the apparent naturalness of interactions but scarcely enhances goal\nachievement in cooperative scenarios. Our findings indicate that addressing\ninformation asymmetry remains a fundamental challenge for LLM-based agents.\n","authors":["Xuhui Zhou","Zhe Su","Tiwalayo Eisape","Hyunwoo Kim","Maarten Sap"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.05020v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05342v4","updated":"2024-03-20T20:37:17Z","published":"2023-08-10T05:10:17Z","title":"Metacognitive Prompting Improves Understanding in Large Language Models","summary":"  In Large Language Models (LLMs), there have been consistent advancements in\ntask-specific performance, largely influenced by effective prompt design.\nRecent advancements in prompting have enhanced reasoning in logic-intensive\ntasks for LLMs, yet the nuanced understanding abilities of these models,\ncrucial for processing and interpreting complex information, remain\nunderexplored.

The expanding variety of\nPre-Trained VLMs enhances the likelihood of identifying a suitable VLM for\nspecific tasks. Thus, a promising zero-shot image classification strategy is\nselecting the most appropriate Pre-Trained VLM from the VLM Zoo, relying solely\non the text data of the target dataset without access to the dataset's images.\nIn this paper, we analyze two inherent challenges in assessing the ability of a\nVLM in this Language-Only VLM selection: the \"Modality Gap\" -- the disparity in\nVLM's embeddings across two different modalities, making text a less reliable\nsubstitute for images; and the \"Capability Gap\" -- the discrepancy between the\nVLM's overall ranking and its ranking for target dataset, hindering direct\nprediction of a model's dataset-specific performance from its general\nperformance.

The input-specific\nadaptation phase involves conducting efficient and effective pseudo outpainting\nlearning on the single-shot source video. This process encourages the model to\nidentify and learn patterns within the source video, as well as bridging the\ngap between standard generative processes and outpainting. The subsequent\nphase, pattern-aware outpainting, is dedicated to the generalization of these\nlearned patterns to generate outpainting outcomes. Additional strategies\nincluding spatial-aware insertion and noise travel are proposed to better\nleverage the diffusion model's generative prior and the acquired video patterns\nfrom source videos. Extensive evaluations underscore MOTIA's superiority,\noutperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in widely recognized\nbenchmarks. Notably, these advancements are achieved without necessitating\nextensive, task-specific tuning.\n","authors":["Fu-Yun Wang","Xiaoshi Wu","Zhaoyang Huang","Xiaoyu Shi","Dazhong Shen","Guanglu Song","Yu Liu","Hongsheng Li"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13745v1.pdf","comment":"Code will be available at https://github.com/G-U-N/Be-Your-Outpainter"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05666v5","updated":"2024-03-20T16:50:25Z","published":"2023-02-11T11:56:06Z","title":"Jaccard Metric Losses: Optimizing the Jaccard Index with Soft Labels","summary":"  Intersection over Union (IoU) losses are surrogates that directly optimize\nthe Jaccard index.

Unfortunately,\noptical imaging is vulnerable to image degradation due to laser scattering and\nabsorption, which can result in diagnostic errors and misguided treatment.\nRestoration of optical images is a challenging computer vision task because the\nsources of image degradation are multi-factorial, stochastic, and\ntissue-dependent, preventing a straightforward method to obtain paired\nlow-quality/high-quality data. Here, we present Restorative Step-Calibrated\nDiffusion (RSCD), an unpaired image restoration method that views the image\nrestoration problem as completing the finishing steps of a diffusion-based\nimage generation task. RSCD uses a step calibrator model to dynamically\ndetermine the severity of image degradation and the number of steps required to\ncomplete the reverse diffusion process for image restoration. RSCD outperforms\nother widely used unpaired image restoration methods on both image quality and\nperceptual evaluation metrics for restoring optical images. Medical imaging\nexperts consistently prefer images restored using RSCD in blinded comparison\nexperiments and report minimal to no hallucinations.

Many\nworks have investigated the effect of widely adopted data augmentation and\nadversarial training techniques, termed data enhancement in the paper, on the\nprivacy leakage of machine learning models. Such privacy effects are often\nmeasured by membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to identify whether\na particular example belongs to the training set or not. We propose to\ninvestigate privacy from a new perspective called memorization. Through the\nlens of memorization, we find that previously deployed MIAs produce misleading\nresults as they are less likely to identify samples with higher privacy risks\nas members compared to samples with low privacy risks. To solve this problem,\nwe deploy a recent attack that can capture individual samples' memorization\ndegrees for evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we unveil several\nfindings about the connections between three essential properties of machine\nlearning models, including privacy, generalization gap, and adversarial\nrobustness. We demonstrate that the generalization gap and privacy leakage are\nless correlated than those of the previous results. Moreover, there is not\nnecessarily a trade-off between adversarial robustness and privacy as stronger\nadversarial robustness does not make the model more susceptible to privacy\nattacks.\n","authors":["Xiao Li","Qiongxiu Li","Zhanhao Hu","Xiaolin Hu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08270v3.pdf","comment":"Accepted by IEEE TIFS, 17 pages"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12425v2","updated":"2024-03-20T13:56:56Z","published":"2024-03-19T04:25:54Z","title":"Multimodal Fusion Method with Spatiotemporal Sequences and Relationship\n  Learning for Valence-Arousal Estimation","summary":"  This paper presents our approach for the VA (Valence-Arousal) estimation task\nin the ABAW6 competition.

To\nencapsulate these principles, we propose a new methodology that includes\nconsistency and inconsistency modules, supported by a unique pull-push loss\n(P2L) mechanism. The IVAC-P2L model applies a pull loss to promote coherence\namong cycle segment features and a push loss to clearly distinguish features of\ncycle segments from interval segments. Empirical evaluations conducted on the\nRepCount dataset demonstrate that the IVAC-P2L model sets a new benchmark in\nVAC task performance. Furthermore, the model demonstrates exceptional\nadaptability and generalization across various video contents, outperforming\nexisting models on two additional datasets, UCFRep and Countix, without the\nneed for dataset-specific optimization.

This may transfer\nambiguous knowledge to the student and mislead its learning. To this end, we\npropose a simple but effective method, i.e., Scale Decoupled Distillation\n(SDD), for logit knowledge distillation. SDD decouples the global logit output\ninto multiple local logit outputs and establishes distillation pipelines for\nthem.

Previous works adopt the conventional\nclassification architecture, which consists of a feature extractor and a\nclassifier. The feature extractor is shared across sequentially arrived tasks\nor classes, but one specific group of weights of the classifier corresponding\nto one new class should be incrementally expanded. Consequently, the parameters\nof a continual learner gradually increase. Moreover, as the classifier contains\nall historical arrived classes, a certain size of the memory is usually\nrequired to store rehearsal data to mitigate classifier bias and catastrophic\nforgetting. In this paper, we propose a non-incremental learner, named\nAttriCLIP, to incrementally extract knowledge of new classes or tasks.\nSpecifically, AttriCLIP is built upon the pre-trained visual-language model\nCLIP. Its image encoder and text encoder are fixed to extract features from\nboth images and text. Text consists of a category name and a fixed number of\nlearnable parameters which are selected from our designed attribute word bank\nand serve as attributes. As we compute the visual and textual similarity for\nclassification, AttriCLIP is a non-incremental learner. The attribute prompts,\nwhich encode the common knowledge useful for classification, can effectively\nmitigate the catastrophic forgetting and avoid constructing a replay memory. We\nevaluate our AttriCLIP and compare it with CLIP-based and previous\nstate-of-the-art continual learning methods in realistic settings with\ndomain-shift and long-sequence learning.

Unfortunately, synthesizing novel views remains to be a\nchallenge for input views with heterogeneous brightness level captured under\nlow-light condition. The condition is pretty common in the real world. It\ncauses low-contrast images where details are concealed in the darkness and\ncamera sensor noise significantly degrades the image quality. To tackle this\nproblem, we propose to learn to decompose illumination, reflectance, and noise\nfrom input views according to that reflectance remains invariant across\nheterogeneous views. To cope with heterogeneous brightness and noise levels\nacross multi-views, we learn an illumination embedding and optimize a noise map\nindividually for each view. To allow intuitive editing of the illumination, we\ndesign an illumination adjustment module to enable either brightening or\ndarkening of the illumination component.

We point out that MiO\nIR faces two pivotal challenges: the optimization of diverse objectives and the\nadaptation to multiple tasks. To tackle these challenges, we present two simple\nyet effective strategies. The first strategy, referred to as sequential\nlearning, attempts to address how to optimize the diverse objectives, which\nguides the network to incrementally learn individual IR tasks in a sequential\nmanner rather than mixing them together.

Recently, efforts have been made to train\nlanguage agents for performance improvement, with multi-step reasoning and\naction trajectories as the training data. However, collecting such trajectories\nstill requires considerable human effort, by either artificial annotations or\nimplementations of diverse prompting frameworks. In this work, we propose\nA$^3$T, a framework that enables the Autonomous Annotation of Agent\nTrajectories in the style of ReAct. The central role is an ActRe prompting\nagent, which explains the reason for an arbitrary action. When randomly\nsampling an external action, the ReAct-style agent could query the ActRe agent\nwith the action to obtain its textual rationales. Novel trajectories are then\nsynthesized by prepending the posterior reasoning from ActRe to the sampled\naction. In this way, the ReAct-style agent executes multiple trajectories for\nthe failed tasks, and selects the successful ones to supplement its failed\ntrajectory for contrastive self-training. Realized by policy gradient methods\nwith binarized rewards, the contrastive self-training with accumulated\ntrajectories facilitates a closed loop for multiple rounds of language agent\nself-improvement. We conduct experiments using QLoRA fine-tuning with the\nopen-sourced Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2. In AlfWorld, the agent trained with\nA$^3$T obtains a 1-shot success rate of 96%, and 100% success with 4 iterative\nrounds. In WebShop, the 1-shot performance of the A$^3$T agent matches human\naverage, and 4 rounds of iterative refinement lead to the performance\napproaching human experts.

Second, bilingual data were used for pretraining to\nalign the high- and less-resourced languages. Third, a high-quality small-scale\ninstruction dataset was constructed and instruction-tuning was performed to\naugment the LRL. The experiments employed the Llama2 model and Korean was used\nas the LRL, which was quantitatively evaluated against other developed LLMs\nacross eight tasks. Furthermore, a qualitative assessment was performed based\non human evaluation and GPT4. Experimental results showed that our proposed\nBllossom model exhibited superior performance in qualitative analyses compared\nto previously proposed Korean monolingual models.\n","authors":["ChangSu Choi","Yongbin Jeong","Seoyoon Park","InHo Won","HyeonSeok Lim","SangMin Kim","Yejee Kang","Chanhyuk Yoon","Jaewan Park","Yiseul Lee","HyeJin Lee","Younggyun Hahm","Hansaem Kim","KyungTae Lim"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.10882v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14443v1","updated":"2024-03-21T14:48:37Z","published":"2024-03-21T14:48:37Z","title":"Language Models Can Reduce Asymmetry in Information Markets","summary":"  This work addresses the buyer's inspection paradox for information markets.\nThe paradox is that buyers need to access information to determine its value,\nwhile sellers need to limit access to prevent theft.

The central mechanism enabling this marketplace is the\nagents' dual capabilities: they not only have the capacity to assess the\nquality of privileged information but also come equipped with the ability to\nforget. This ability to induce amnesia allows vendors to grant temporary access\nto proprietary information, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized\nretention while enabling agents to accurately gauge the information's relevance\nto specific queries or tasks.

In this paper, instead of discarding low-quality\nsamples, we propose CoachLM, a novel approach to enhance the quality of\ninstruction datasets through automatic revisions on samples in the dataset.\nCoachLM is trained from the samples revised by human experts and significantly\nincreases the proportion of high-quality samples in the dataset from 17.7% to\n78.9%. The effectiveness of CoachLM is further assessed on various real-world\ninstruction test sets. The results show that CoachLM improves the\ninstruction-following capabilities of the instruction-tuned LLM by an average\nof 29.9%, which even surpasses larger LLMs with nearly twice the number of\nparameters. Furthermore, CoachLM is successfully deployed in a data management\nsystem for LLMs at Huawei, resulting in an efficiency improvement of up to 20%\nin the cleaning of 40k real-world instruction pairs. We release various assets\nof CoachLM, including the training data, code and test set\n(https://github.com/lunyiliu/CoachLM).\n","authors":["Yilun Liu","Shimin Tao","Xiaofeng Zhao","Ming Zhu","Wenbing Ma","Junhao Zhu","Chang Su","Yutai Hou","Miao Zhang","Min Zhang","Hongxia Ma","Li Zhang","Hao Yang","Yanfei Jiang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.13246v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted by ICDE 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13257v2","updated":"2024-03-21T03:13:30Z","published":"2024-03-20T02:38:01Z","title":"Arcee's MergeKit: A Toolkit for Merging Large Language Models","summary":"  The rapid expansion of the open-source language model landscape presents an\nopportunity to merge the competencies of these model checkpoints by combining\ntheir parameters.

There are two major limitations of previous video-language alignment\napproaches. First, they do not capture both short-range and long-range temporal\ndependencies and typically employ complex hierarchical deep network\narchitectures that are hard to integrate with existing pretrained image-text\nfoundation models. To effectively address this limitation, we instead keep the\nnetwork architecture simple and use a set of data tokens that operate at\ndifferent temporal resolutions in a hierarchical manner, accounting for the\ntemporally hierarchical nature of videos. By employing a simple two-tower\narchitecture, we are able to initialize our video-language model with\npretrained image-text foundation models, thereby boosting the final\nperformance. Second, existing video-language alignment works struggle due to\nthe lack of semantically aligned large-scale training data. To overcome it, we\nleverage recent LLMs to curate the largest video-language dataset to date with\nbetter visual grounding. Furthermore, unlike existing video-text datasets which\nonly contain short clips, our dataset is enriched with video clips of varying\ndurations to aid our temporally hierarchical data tokens in extracting better\nrepresentations at varying temporal scales. Overall, empirical results show\nthat our proposed approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on multiple\nretrieval benchmarks, especially on longer videos, and performs competitively\non classification benchmarks.\n","authors":["Mamshad Nayeem Rizve","Fan Fei","Jayakrishnan Unnikrishnan","Son Tran","Benjamin Z.

The key components\nare:(i) a short-term memory block called conditional attention module (CAM),\nwhich conditions the current generation on the features extracted from the\nprevious chunk via an attentional mechanism, leading to consistent chunk\ntransitions, (ii) a long-term memory block called appearance preservation\nmodule, which extracts high-level scene and object features from the first\nvideo chunk to prevent the model from forgetting the initial scene, and (iii) a\nrandomized blending approach that enables to apply a video enhancer\nautoregressively for infinitely long videos without inconsistencies between\nchunks.

This approach allows MathVerse to comprehensively assess whether and how\nmuch MLLMs can truly understand the visual diagrams for mathematical reasoning.\nIn addition, we propose a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation strategy for a\nfine-grained assessment of the output answers. Rather than naively judging True\nor False, we employ GPT-4(V) to adaptively extract crucial reasoning steps, and\nthen score each step with detailed error analysis, which can reveal the\nintermediate CoT reasoning quality by MLLMs. We hope the MathVerse benchmark\nmay provide unique insights to guide the future development of MLLMs. Project\npage: https://mathverse-cuhk.github.io\n","authors":["Renrui Zhang","Dongzhi Jiang","Yichi Zhang","Haokun Lin","Ziyu Guo","Pengshuo Qiu","Aojun Zhou","Pan Lu","Kai-Wei Chang","Peng Gao","Hongsheng Li"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14624v1.pdf","comment":"46 Pages, Work in Progress, Benchmark Project Page:\n  https://mathverse-cuhk.github.io"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14623v1","updated":"2024-03-21T17:59:41Z","published":"2024-03-21T17:59:41Z","title":"Simplified Diffusion Schr√∂dinger Bridge","summary":"  This paper introduces a novel theoretical simplification of the Diffusion\nSchr\\\"odinger Bridge (DSB) that facilitates its unification with Score-based\nGenerative Models (SGMs), addressing the limitations of DSB in complex data\ngeneration and enabling faster convergence and enhanced performance.

These degradations typically\narise from the inherent limitations of cameras or unfavorable ambient\nconditions. To recover clean images from degraded versions, numerous\nspecialized restoration methods have been developed, each targeting a specific\ntype of degradation. Recently, all-in-one algorithms have garnered significant\nattention by addressing different types of degradations within a single model\nwithout requiring prior information of the input degradation type. However,\nthese methods purely operate in the spatial domain and do not delve into the\ndistinct frequency variations inherent to different degradation types. To\naddress this gap, we propose an adaptive all-in-one image restoration network\nbased on frequency mining and modulation. Our approach is motivated by the\nobservation that different degradation types impact the image content on\ndifferent frequency subbands, thereby requiring different treatments for each\nrestoration task. Specifically, we first mine low- and high-frequency\ninformation from the input features, guided by the adaptively decoupled spectra\nof the degraded image. The extracted features are then modulated by a\nbidirectional operator to facilitate interactions between different frequency\ncomponents. Finally, the modulated features are merged into the original input\nfor a progressively guided restoration. With this approach, the model achieves\nadaptive reconstruction by accentuating the informative frequency subbands\naccording to different input degradations. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on different\nimage restoration tasks, including denoising, dehazing, deraining, motion\ndeblurring, and low-light image enhancement.

In this paper, we introduce AnyV2V, a novel\ntraining-free framework designed to simplify video editing into two primary\nsteps: (1) employing an off-the-shelf image editing model (e.g.\nInstructPix2Pix, InstantID, etc) to modify the first frame, (2) utilizing an\nexisting image-to-video generation model (e.g. I2VGen-XL) for DDIM inversion\nand feature injection. In the first stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing\nimage editing tools to support an extensive array of video editing tasks.\nBeyond the traditional prompt-based editing methods, AnyV2V also can support\nnovel video editing tasks, including reference-based style transfer,\nsubject-driven editing, and identity manipulation, which were unattainable by\nprevious methods. In the second stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing\nimage-to-video models to perform DDIM inversion and intermediate feature\ninjection to maintain the appearance and motion consistency with the source\nvideo. On the prompt-based editing, we show that AnyV2V can outperform the\nprevious best approach by 35\\% on prompt alignment, and 25\\% on human\npreference. On the three novel tasks, we show that AnyV2V also achieves a high\nsuccess rate. We believe AnyV2V will continue to thrive due to its ability to\nseamlessly integrate the fast-evolving image editing methods. Such\ncompatibility can help AnyV2V to increase its versatility to cater to diverse\nuser demands.\n","authors":["Max Ku","Cong Wei","Weiming Ren","Huan Yang","Wenhu Chen"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14468v1.pdf","comment":"preprint"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14465v1","updated":"2024-03-21T15:13:36Z","published":"2024-03-21T15:13:36Z","title":"CathFlow: Self-Supervised Segmentation of Catheters in Interventional\n  Ultrasound Using Optical Flow and Transformers","summary":"  In minimally invasive endovascular procedures, contrast-enhanced angiography\nremains the most robust imaging technique. However, it is at the expense of the\npatient and clinician's health due to prolonged radiation exposure. As an\nalternative, interventional ultrasound has notable benefits such as being\nradiation-free, fast to deploy, and having a small footprint in the operating\nroom. Yet, ultrasound is hard to interpret, and highly prone to artifacts and\nnoise. Additionally, interventional radiologists must undergo extensive\ntraining before they become qualified to diagnose and treat patients\neffectively, leading to a shortage of staff, and a lack of open-source\ndatasets. In this work, we seek to address both problems by introducing a\nself-supervised deep learning architecture to segment catheters in longitudinal\nultrasound images, without demanding any labeled data. The network architecture\nbuilds upon AiAReSeg, a segmentation transformer built with the Attention in\nAttention mechanism, and is capable of learning feature changes across time and\nspace. To facilitate training, we used synthetic ultrasound data based on\nphysics-driven catheter insertion simulations, and translated the data into a\nunique CT-Ultrasound common domain, CACTUSS, to improve the segmentation\nperformance. We generated ground truth segmentation masks by computing the\noptical flow between adjacent frames using FlowNet2, and performed thresholding\nto obtain a binary map estimate.

However, their inference process\ncharacteristically requires numerous, potentially hundreds, of iterative steps,\nwhich could exaggerate the problem of exposure bias due to the training and\ninference discrepancy. Previous work has attempted to mitigate this issue by\nperturbing inputs during training, which consequently mandates the retraining\nof the DPM. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of exposure bias in DPM\nand, intriguingly, we find that the exposure bias could be alleviated with a\nnovel sampling method that we propose, without retraining the model. We\nempirically and theoretically show that, during inference, for each backward\ntime step $t$ and corresponding state $\\hat{x}_t$, there might exist another\ntime step $t_s$ which exhibits superior coupling with $\\hat{x}_t$. Based on\nthis finding, we introduce a sampling method named Time-Shift Sampler. Our\nframework can be seamlessly integrated to existing sampling algorithms, such as\nDDPM, DDIM and other high-order solvers, inducing merely minimal additional\ncomputations. Experimental results show our method brings significant and\nconsistent improvements in FID scores on different datasets and sampling\nmethods.

Although larger CNNs generally exhibit higher accuracy,\ntheir size can be effectively reduced by \"tensorization\" while maintaining\naccuracy. Tensorization consists of replacing the convolution kernels with\ncompact decompositions such as Tucker, Canonical Polyadic decompositions, or\nquantum-inspired decompositions such as matrix product states, and directly\ntraining the factors in the decompositions to bias the learning towards\nlow-rank decompositions. But why doesn't tensorization seem to impact the\naccuracy adversely? We explore this by assessing how truncating the convolution\nkernels of dense (untensorized) CNNs impact their accuracy. Specifically, we\ntruncated the kernels of (i) a vanilla four-layer CNN and (ii) ResNet-50\npre-trained for image classification on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. We\nfound that kernels (especially those inside deeper layers) could often be\ntruncated along several cuts resulting in significant loss in kernel norm but\nnot in classification accuracy. This suggests that such ``correlation\ncompression'' (underlying tensorization) is an intrinsic feature of how\ninformation is encoded in dense CNNs. We also found that aggressively truncated\nmodels could often recover the pre-truncation accuracy after only a few epochs\nof re-training, suggesting that compressing the internal correlations of\nconvolution layers does not often transport the model to a worse minimum.

In this paper, we propose a\nsimple yet powerful pipeline to reduce the artifact patterns of fake images\nwithout hurting image quality by performing implicit spatial-domain notch\nfiltering.

We\nadopt a combination of adding overwhelming spatial noise for breaking the\nperiodic noise pattern and deep image filtering to reconstruct the noise-free\nfake images, and we name our method DeepNotch. Deep image filtering provides a\nspecialized filter for each pixel in the noisy image, producing filtered images\nwith high fidelity compared to their DeepFake counterparts.

LMMs typically use a\nfixed amount of visual tokens, such as the penultimate layer features in the\nCLIP visual encoder, as the prefix content. Recent LMMs incorporate more\ncomplex visual inputs, such as high-resolution images and videos, which\nincrease the number of visual tokens significantly. However, due to the design\nof the Transformer architecture, computational costs associated with these\nmodels tend to increase quadratically with the number of input tokens. To\ntackle this problem, we explore a token reduction mechanism and find, similar\nto prior work, that many visual tokens are spatially redundant. Based on this,\nwe propose PruMerge, a novel adaptive visual token reduction approach, which\nlargely reduces the number of visual tokens while maintaining comparable model\nperformance. We first select the unpruned visual tokens based on their\nsimilarity to class tokens and spatial tokens. We then cluster the pruned\ntokens based on key similarity and merge the clustered tokens with the unpruned\ntokens to supplement their information.

In this work, we show that a simple and\nscalable combination of learning rate (LR) re-warming, LR re-decaying, and\nreplay of previous data is sufficient to match the performance of fully\nre-training from scratch on all available data, as measured by final loss and\nlanguage model (LM) evaluation benchmarks.

Safety training focuses on\nfurther training LLM to enhance its safety.

The benchmark is constructed from a variety of sources and\ncovers a wide range of 500 characters and over 6,000 question prompts and\n30,800 multi-turn role-playing utterances. We conduct comprehensive evaluations\non this benchmark using mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs. We find\nthat agents excelling in individual level does not imply their proficiency in\ngroup level. Moreover, the behavior of individuals may drift as a result of the\ninfluence exerted by other agents within the group. Experimental results on\nRoleInteract confirm its significance as a testbed for assessing the social\ninteraction of role-playing conversational agents. The benchmark is publicly\naccessible at https://github.com/X-PLUG/RoleInteract.\n","authors":["Hongzhan Chen","Hehong Chen","Ming Yan","Wenshen Xu","Xing Gao","Weizhou Shen","Xiaojun Quan","Chenliang Li","Ji Zhang","Fei Huang","Jingren Zhou"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13679v3.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07766v2","updated":"2024-03-22T00:28:51Z","published":"2023-05-12T21:22:08Z","title":"NL2TL: Transforming Natural Languages to Temporal Logics using Large\n  Language Models","summary":"  Temporal Logic (TL) can be used to rigorously specify complex high-level\nspecification for systems in many engineering applications.

Our contributions are twofold. First, we develop a\nframework to create a dataset of NL-TL pairs combining LLMs and human\nannotation. We publish a dataset with 28K NL-TL pairs. Then, we finetune T5\nmodels on the lifted versions (i.e., the specific Atomic Propositions (AP) are\nhidden) of the NL and TL. The enhanced generalizability originates from two\naspects: 1) Usage of lifted NL-TL characterizes common logical structures,\nwithout constraints of specific domains. 2) Application of LLMs in dataset\ncreation largely enhances corpus richness. We test the generalization of\ntrained models on five varied domains. To achieve full NL-TL transformation, we\neither combine the lifted model with AP recognition task or do the further\nfinetuning on each specific domain.

Recent\nadvances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for translating\nnatural language into robot action sequences for complex tasks. However,\nexisting approaches either translate the natural language directly into robot\ntrajectories or factor the inference process by decomposing language into task\nsub-goals and relying on a motion planner to execute each sub-goal. When\ncomplex environmental and temporal constraints are involved, inference over\nplanning tasks must be performed jointly with motion plans using traditional\ntask-and-motion planning (TAMP) algorithms, making factorization into subgoals\nuntenable. Rather than using LLMs to directly plan task sub-goals, we instead\nperform few-shot translation from natural language task descriptions to an\nintermediate task representation that can then be consumed by a TAMP algorithm\nto jointly solve the task and motion plan. To improve translation, we\nautomatically detect and correct both syntactic and semantic errors via\nautoregressive re-prompting, resulting in significant improvements in task\ncompletion.

Recent LMMs incorporate more\ncomplex visual inputs, such as high-resolution images and videos, which\nincrease the number of visual tokens significantly.

While arthroplasty has known several technical\nimprovements, a significant share of patients are still unsatisfied with their\nsurgery. Personalised arthroplasty improves surgical outcomes however current\nsolutions require delays, making it difficult to integrate in clinical routine.\nWe propose a fully automated workflow to design patient-specific implants,\npresented for total knee arthroplasty, the most widely performed arthroplasty\nin the world nowadays.\n  The proposed pipeline first uses artificial neural networks to segment the\nproximal and distal extremities of the femur and tibia. Then the full bones are\nreconstructed using augmented statistical shape models, combining shape and\nlandmarks information. Finally, 77 morphological parameters are computed to\ndesign patient-specific implants. The developed workflow has been trained using\n91 CT scans of lower limb and evaluated on 41 CT scans manually segmented, in\nterms of accuracy and execution time.\n  The workflow accuracy was $0.4\\pm0.2mm$ for the segmentation, $1.2\\pm0.4mm$\nfor the full bones reconstruction, and $2.8\\pm2.2mm$ for the anatomical\nlandmarks determination. The custom implants fitted the patients' anatomy with\n$0.6\\pm0.2mm$ accuracy. The whole process from segmentation to implants' design\nlasted about 5 minutes.\n  The proposed workflow allows for a fast and reliable personalisation of knee\nimplants, directly from the patient CT image without requiring any manual\nintervention. It establishes a patient-specific pre-operative planning for TKA\nin a very short time making it easily available for all patients. Combined with\nefficient implant manufacturing techniques, this solution could help answer the\ngrowing number of arthroplasties while reducing complications and improving the\npatients' satisfaction.\n","authors":["Aziliz Guezou-Philippe","Arnaud Clav√©","Ehouarn Maguet","Ludivine Maintier","Charles Garraud","Jean-Rassaire Fouefack","Val√©rie Burdin","Eric Stindel","Guillaume Dardenne"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15353v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14125v3","updated":"2024-03-22T17:06:53Z","published":"2023-12-21T18:46:41Z","title":"VideoPoet: A Large Language Model for Zero-Shot Video Generation","summary":"  We present VideoPoet, a language model capable of synthesizing high-quality\nvideo, with matching audio, from a large variety of conditioning signals.\nVideoPoet employs a decoder-only transformer architecture that processes\nmultimodal inputs -- including images, videos, text, and audio.

However, training vision transformers for high-resolution\npixelwise tasks has a prohibitive cost. Typical solutions boil down to\nhierarchical architectures, fast and approximate attention, or training on\nlow-resolution crops. This latter solution does not constrain architectural\nchoices, but it leads to a clear performance drop when testing at resolutions\nsignificantly higher than that used for training, thus requiring ad-hoc and\nslow post-processing schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for\nefficient training and inference of high-resolution vision transformers. The\nkey principle is to mask out most of the high-resolution inputs during\ntraining, keeping only N random windows. This allows the model to learn local\ninteractions between tokens inside each window, and global interactions between\ntokens from different windows. As a result, the model can directly process the\nhigh-resolution input at test time without any special trick. We show that this\nstrategy is effective when using relative positional embedding such as rotary\nembeddings. It is 4 times faster to train than a full-resolution network, and\nit is straightforward to use at test time compared to existing approaches.

However, the deployment of VLMs\nnecessitates substantial energy consumption and computational resources. Once\nattackers maliciously induce high energy consumption and latency time\n(energy-latency cost) during inference of VLMs, it will exhaust computational\nresources. In this paper, we explore this attack surface about availability of\nVLMs and aim to induce high energy-latency cost during inference of VLMs. We\nfind that high energy-latency cost during inference of VLMs can be manipulated\nby maximizing the length of generated sequences. To this end, we propose\nverbose images, with the goal of crafting an imperceptible perturbation to\ninduce VLMs to generate long sentences during inference. Concretely, we design\nthree loss objectives. First, a loss is proposed to delay the occurrence of\nend-of-sequence (EOS) token, where EOS token is a signal for VLMs to stop\ngenerating further tokens. Moreover, an uncertainty loss and a token diversity\nloss are proposed to increase the uncertainty over each generated token and the\ndiversity among all tokens of the whole generated sequence, respectively, which\ncan break output dependency at token-level and sequence-level. Furthermore, a\ntemporal weight adjustment algorithm is proposed, which can effectively balance\nthese losses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our verbose images can\nincrease the length of generated sequences by 7.87 times and 8.56 times\ncompared to original images on MS-COCO and ImageNet datasets, which presents\npotential challenges for various applications.

To this end, we propose the DevLSTM module,\nwhich exploits the path development -- a principled and parsimonious\nrepresentation for sequential data by leveraging the Lie group structure. The\npath development, originated from Rough path theory, can effectively capture\nthe order of events in high-dimensional stream data with massive dimension\nreduction and consequently enhance the LSTM module substantially. Our proposed\nG-DevLSTM module can be conveniently plugged into the temporal graph,\ncomplementing existing advanced GCN-based models. Our empirical studies on the\nNTU60, NTU120 and Chalearn2013 datasets demonstrate that our proposed hybrid\nmodel significantly outperforms the current best-performing methods in SAR\ntasks.

In applications such\nas autonomous driving, lidar measurements in the form of point clouds are\nusually passed through a \"virtual sensor\" realized by a deep learning model, to\nproduce \"measurements\" such as bounding boxes, which are in turn ingested by a\ntracking module to produce object tracks. Very often multiple lidar sweeps are\naccumulated in a buffer to merge and become the input to the virtual sensor. We\nargue in this paper that such an input already contains temporal information,\nand therefore the virtual sensor output should also contain temporal\ninformation, not just instantaneous values for the time corresponding to the\nend of the buffer. In particular, we present the deep learning model called\nMULti-Sweep PAired Detector (MULSPAD) that produces, for each detected object,\na pair of bounding boxes at both the end time and the beginning time of the\ninput buffer.

Few-shot segmentation techniques reduce the required number of images to\nlearn to segment a new class, but careful annotations of object boundaries are\nstill required.

We\ncombine the two concepts to drastically reduce the effort required to train\nsegmentation models for novel classes. Instead of trivially feeding interactive\nsegmentation masks as ground truth to a few-shot segmentation model, we propose\nIFSENet, which can accept sparse supervision on a single or few support images\nin the form of clicks to generate masks on support (training, at least clicked\nupon once) as well as query (test, never clicked upon) images. To trade-off\neffort for accuracy flexibly, the number of images and clicks can be\nincrementally added to the support set to further improve the segmentation of\nsupport as well as query images. The proposed model approaches the accuracy of\nprevious state-of-the-art few-shot segmentation models with considerably lower\nannotation effort (clicks instead of maps), when tested on Pascal and SBD\ndatasets on query images.

However, its direct adaption in medical image\nsegmentation tasks shows significant performance drops with inferior accuracy\nand unstable results. It may also requires an excessive number of prompt points\nto obtain a reasonable accuracy. For segmenting 3D radiological CT or MRI\nscans, a 2D SAM model has to separately handle hundreds of 2D slices. Although\nquite a few studies explore adapting SAM into medical image volumes, the\nefficiency of 2D adaption methods is unsatisfactory and 3D adaptation methods\nonly capable of segmenting specific organs/tumors. In this work, we propose a\ncomprehensive and scalable 3D SAM model for whole-body CT segmentation, named\nCT-SAM3D. Instead of adapting SAM, we propose a 3D promptable segmentation\nmodel using a (nearly) fully labeled CT dataset. To train CT-SAM3D effectively,\nensuring the model's accurate responses to higher-dimensional spatial prompts\nis crucial, and 3D patch-wise training is required due to GPU memory\nconstraints. For this purpose, we propose two key technical developments: 1) a\nprogressively and spatially aligned prompt encoding method to effectively\nencode click prompts in local 3D space; and 2) a cross-patch prompt learning\nscheme to capture more 3D spatial context, which is beneficial for reducing the\nediting workloads when interactively prompting on large organs.

With the rapid deployment of deep neural networks\nfor SOD tasks, the demand for high-quality training samples soars. The\ntraditional, also reliable, way is manual labeling over the dense LiDAR point\nclouds and reference images.

When it contains only specific types of images, the classifier begins\nto rely on shortcuts - simplistic and erroneous rules for decision-making. This\nleads to high performance on the training dataset but inferior results on new,\nvaried images, as the classifier's generalization capability is reduced. For\nexample, if the images labeled as mustache consist solely of male figures, the\nmodel may inadvertently learn to classify images by gender rather than the\npresence of a mustache. One approach to mitigate such biases is to direct the\nmodel's attention toward the target object's location, usually marked using\nbounding boxes or polygons for annotation. However, collecting such annotations\nrequires substantial time and human effort. Therefore, we propose a novel\npatch-labeling method that integrates AI assistance with crowdsourcing to\ncapture human attention from images, which can be a viable solution for\nmitigating bias. Our method consists of two steps. First, we extract the\napproximate location of a target using a pre-trained saliency detection model\nsupplemented by human verification for accuracy. Then, we determine the\nhuman-attentive area in the image by iteratively dividing the image into\nsmaller patches and employing crowdsourcing to ascertain whether each patch can\nbe classified as the target object. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our\nmethod in mitigating bias through improved classification accuracy and the\nrefined focus of the model. Also, crowdsourced experiments validate that our\nmethod collects human annotation up to 3.4 times faster than annotating object\nlocations with polygons, significantly reducing the need for human resources.\nWe conclude the paper by discussing the advantages of our method in a\ncrowdsourcing context, mainly focusing on aspects of human errors and\naccessibility.\n","authors":["Minsuk Chang","Seokhyeon Park","Hyeon Jeon","Aeri Cho","Soohyun Lee","Jinwook Seo"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15013v1.pdf","comment":"21 pages, 11 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00029v3","updated":"2024-03-22T07:52:28Z","published":"2023-12-29T05:28:35Z","title":"6D-Diff: A Keypoint Diffusion Framework for 6D Object Pose Estimation","summary":"  Estimating the 6D object pose from a single RGB image often involves noise\nand indeterminacy due to challenges such as occlusions and cluttered\nbackgrounds.

Nevertheless, in this paper, we propose clean-image\nbackdoor attacks which uncover that backdoors can still be injected via a\nfraction of incorrect labels without modifying the training images.\nSpecifically, in our attacks, the attacker first seeks a trigger feature to\ndivide the training images into two parts: those with the feature and those\nwithout it. Subsequently, the attacker falsifies the labels of the former part\nto a backdoor class. The backdoor will be finally implanted into the target\nmodel after it is trained on the poisoned data. During the inference phase, the\nattacker can activate the backdoor in two ways: slightly modifying the input\nimage to obtain the trigger feature, or taking an image that naturally has the\ntrigger feature as input.

However, existing gait recognition methods heavily rely on\ntask-specific upstream driven by supervised learning to provide explicit gait\nrepresentations like silhouette sequences, which inevitably introduce expensive\nannotation costs and potential error accumulation. Escaping from this trend,\nthis work explores effective gait representations based on the all-purpose\nknowledge produced by task-agnostic Large Vision Models (LVMs) and proposes a\nsimple yet efficient gait framework, termed BigGait. Specifically, the Gait\nRepresentation Extractor (GRE) within BigGait draws upon design principles from\nestablished gait representations, effectively transforming all-purpose\nknowledge into implicit gait representations without requiring third-party\nsupervision signals. Experiments on CCPG, CAISA-B* and SUSTech1K indicate that\nBigGait significantly outperforms the previous methods in both within-domain\nand cross-domain tasks in most cases, and provides a more practical paradigm\nfor learning the next-generation gait representation.

This paper considers these priors and proposes a lightweight Large\nSelective Kernel Network (LSKNet) backbone.

In the context of low-resource (LR) MT between two\nclosely-related languages, a natural intuition is to seek benefits from\nstructural \"shortcuts\", such as copying subwords from the source to the target,\ngiven that such language pairs often share a considerable number of identical\nwords, cognates, and borrowings.

Many sought to mitigate this by restricting the\nattention window within the pre-trained length. However, these methods\nintroduce new issues such as ignoring the middle context and requiring\nadditional training. To address these problems, we propose LongHeads, a\ntraining-free framework that enhances LLM's long context ability by unlocking\nmulti-head attention's untapped potential. Instead of allowing each head to\nattend to the full sentence, which struggles with generalizing to longer\nsequences due to out-of-distribution (OOD) issues, we allow each head to\nprocess in-distribution length by selecting and attending to important context\nchunks. To this end, we propose a chunk selection strategy that relies on the\ninherent correlation between the query and the key representations, efficiently\ndistributing context chunks to different heads. In this way, each head ensures\nit can effectively process attended tokens within the trained length, while\ndifferent heads in different layers can collectively process longer contexts.\nLongHeads works efficiently in linear time, fits seamlessly with many LLMs that\nuse relative positional encoding. LongHeads achieves 100% accuracy at the 128k\nlength on passkey retrieval task, verifying LongHeads's efficacy in extending\nthe usable context window for existing models.

Typically,\nthey focus on predicting the input and output of a program, ignoring the\nevaluation of the intermediate behavior during program execution, as well as\nthe logical consistency (e.g., the model should not give the correct output if\nthe prediction of execution path is wrong) when performing the reasoning. To\naddress these problems, in this paper, we propose a framework, namely REval,\nfor evaluating code reasoning abilities and consistency of code LLMs with\nprogram execution.

This policy is trained by\nreinforcement learning algorithms by taking advantage of an environment in\nwhich an agent receives feedback in the form of a reward signal. The current\ndialogue systems, however, only provide meagre and simplistic rewards.\nInvestigating intrinsic motivation reinforcement learning algorithms is the\ngoal of this study. Through this, the agent can quickly accelerate training and\nimprove its capacity to judge the quality of its actions by teaching it an\ninternal incentive system. In particular, we adapt techniques for random\nnetwork distillation and curiosity-driven reinforcement learning to measure the\nfrequency of state visits and encourage exploration by using semantic\nsimilarity between utterances. Experimental results on MultiWOZ, a\nheterogeneous dataset, show that intrinsic motivation-based debate systems\noutperform policies that depend on extrinsic incentives. By adopting random\nnetwork distillation, for example, which is trained using semantic similarity\nbetween user-system dialogues, an astounding average success rate of 73% is\nachieved.

The relevance between the pretraining pretext and target\ntasks is crucial to the success of transfer learning. Various pretext tasks\nhave been proposed to utilize properties of medical image data (e.g., three\ndimensionality), which are more relevant to medical image analysis than generic\nones for natural images. However, previous work rarely paid attention to data\nwith anatomy-oriented imaging planes, e.g., standard cardiac magnetic resonance\nimaging views. As these imaging planes are defined according to the anatomy of\nthe imaged organ, pretext tasks effectively exploiting this information can\npretrain the networks to gain knowledge on the organ of interest. In this work,\nwe propose two complementary pretext tasks for this group of medical image data\nbased on the spatial relationship of the imaging planes. The first is to learn\nthe relative orientation between the imaging planes and implemented as\nregressing their intersecting lines. The second exploits parallel imaging\nplanes to regress their relative slice locations within a stack. Both pretext\ntasks are conceptually straightforward and easy to implement, and can be\ncombined in multitask learning for better representation learning.

To address this problem, we propose a novel\nRobust Dual Embedding method (RDE) that can learn robust visual-semantic\nassociations even with NC. Specifically, RDE consists of two main components:\n1) A Confident Consensus Division (CCD) module that leverages the dual-grained\ndecisions of dual embedding modules to obtain a consensus set of clean training\ndata, which enables the model to learn correct and reliable visual-semantic\nassociations. 2) A Triplet Alignment Loss (TAL) relaxes the conventional\nTriplet Ranking loss with the hardest negative samples to a log-exponential\nupper bound over all negative ones, thus preventing the model collapse under NC\nand can also focus on hard-negative samples for promising performance. We\nconduct extensive experiments on three public benchmarks, namely CUHK-PEDES,\nICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReID, to evaluate the performance and robustness of our\nRDE. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results both with and without\nsynthetic noisy correspondences on all three datasets.

It\nrequires grasping global information from both parts and the entire image for\nbetter segmenting, and clinically there are often certain requirements for\nsegmentation efficiency. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made\nconsiderable achievements in MIS. However, they are difficult to fully collect\nglobal context information and their pooling layer may cause information loss.\nCapsule networks, which combine the benefits of CNNs while taking into account\nadditional information such as relative location that CNNs do not, have lately\ndemonstrated some advantages in MIS. Vision Transformer (ViT) employs\ntransformers in visual tasks. Transformer based on attention mechanism has\nexcellent global inductive modeling capabilities and is expected to capture\nlongrange information. Moreover, there have been resent studies on making ViT\nmore lightweight to minimize model complexity and increase efficiency. In this\npaper, we propose a U-shaped 3D encoder-decoder network named 3D-EffiViTCaps,\nwhich combines 3D capsule blocks with 3D EfficientViT blocks for MIS.

However, collecting and\nannotating data on a large scale is often both costly and time-intensive,\nparticularly in medical cases where practitioners are already occupied with\ntheir duties. Moreover, ensuring that the model remains robust across various\nscenarios of image capture is crucial in medical domains, especially when\ndealing with ultrasound images that vary based on the settings of different\ndevices and the manual operation of the transducer. To address this challenge,\nwe introduce a novel pipeline called MEDDAP, which leverages Stable Diffusion\n(SD) models to augment existing small datasets by automatically generating new\ninformative labeled samples. Pretrained checkpoints for SD are typically based\non natural images, and training them for medical images requires significant\nGPU resources due to their heavy parameters. To overcome this challenge, we\nintroduce USLoRA (Ultrasound Low-Rank Adaptation), a novel fine-tuning method\ntailored specifically for ultrasound applications. USLoRA allows for selective\nfine-tuning of weights within SD, requiring fewer than 0.1\\% of parameters\ncompared to fully fine-tuning only the UNet portion of SD.

The use of sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models for neural abstractive\ntext summarization has been ascending as far as prevalence. Numerous innovative\nstrategies have been proposed to develop the current seq2seq models further,\npermitting them to handle different issues like saliency, familiarity, and\nhuman lucidness and create excellent synopses. In this article, we aimed toward\nenhancing the present architectures and models for abstractive text\nsummarization. The modifications have been aimed at fine-tuning\nhyper-parameters, attempting specific encoder-decoder combinations. We examined\nmany experiments on an extensively used CNN/DailyMail dataset to check the\neffectiveness of various models.\n","authors":["Aditya Saxena","Ashutosh Ranjan"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16247v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14119v2","updated":"2024-03-24T17:16:53Z","published":"2024-03-21T04:08:29Z","title":"C-TPT: Calibrated Test-Time Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models via\n  Text Feature Dispersion","summary":"  In deep learning, test-time adaptation has gained attention as a method for\nmodel fine-tuning without the need for labeled data. A prime exemplification is\nthe recently proposed test-time prompt tuning for large-scale vision-language\nmodels such as CLIP. Unfortunately, these prompts have been mainly developed to\nimprove accuracy, overlooking the importance of calibration, which is a crucial\naspect for quantifying prediction uncertainty. However, traditional calibration\nmethods rely on substantial amounts of labeled data, making them impractical\nfor test-time scenarios. To this end, this paper explores calibration during\ntest-time prompt tuning by leveraging the inherent properties of CLIP. Through\na series of observations, we find that the prompt choice significantly affects\nthe calibration in CLIP, where the prompts leading to higher text feature\ndispersion result in better-calibrated predictions. Introducing the Average\nText Feature Dispersion (ATFD), we establish its relationship with calibration\nerror and present a novel method, Calibrated Test-time Prompt Tuning (C-TPT),\nfor optimizing prompts during test-time with enhanced calibration. Through\nextensive experiments on different CLIP architectures and datasets, we show\nthat C-TPT can effectively improve the calibration of test-time prompt tuning\nwithout needing labeled data.

Position\nEmbedding (PE) scaling methods, while effective in extending the context window\nto a specific length, demonstrate either notable limitations in their\nextrapolation abilities or sacrificing partial performance within the context\nwindow. Length extrapolation methods, although theoretically capable of\nextending the context window beyond the training sequence length, often\nunderperform in practical long-context applications. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Continuous Length EXtrapolation (CLEX) for LLMs. We\ngeneralise the PE scaling approaches to model the continuous dynamics by\nordinary differential equations over the length scaling factor, thereby\novercoming the constraints of current PE scaling methods designed for specific\nlengths. Moreover, by extending the dynamics to desired context lengths beyond\nthe training sequence length, CLEX facilitates the length extrapolation with\nimpressive performance in practical tasks. We demonstrate that CLEX can be\nseamlessly incorporated into LLMs equipped with Rotary Position Embedding, such\nas LLaMA and GPT-NeoX, with negligible impact on training and inference\nlatency. Experimental results reveal that CLEX can effectively extend the\ncontext window to over 4x or almost 8x training length, with no deterioration\nin performance.

One commonly recognized factor for this\nphenomenon is the model's familiarity with the given prompt or instruction,\nwhich is typically estimated by its perplexity. However, finding the prompt\nwith the lowest perplexity is challenging, given the enormous space of possible\nprompting phrases. In this paper, we propose monotonic paraphrasing (MonoPara),\nan end-to-end decoding strategy that paraphrases given prompts or instructions\ninto their lower perplexity counterparts based on an ensemble of a paraphrase\nLM for prompt (or instruction) rewriting, and a target LM (i.e. the prompt or\ninstruction executor) that constrains the generation for lower perplexity. The\nensemble decoding process can efficiently paraphrase the original prompt\nwithout altering its semantic meaning, while monotonically decreasing the\nperplexity of each generation as calculated by the target LM. We explore in\ndetail both greedy and search-based decoding as two alternative decoding\nschemes of MonoPara.

Leveraging the M3Act synthetic data generator, we\nconduct experiments on DanceTrack and MOT17. Our results suggest that synthetic\ndata not only enhances model performance but also demonstrates substitutability\nfor real data, with 60% to 80% replacement without performance loss.

A prime exemplification is\nthe recently proposed test-time prompt tuning for large-scale vision-language\nmodels such as CLIP. Unfortunately, these prompts have been mainly developed to\nimprove accuracy, overlooking the importance of calibration, which is a crucial\naspect for quantifying prediction uncertainty. However, traditional calibration\nmethods rely on substantial amounts of labeled data, making them impractical\nfor test-time scenarios. To this end, this paper explores calibration during\ntest-time prompt tuning by leveraging the inherent properties of CLIP. Through\na series of observations, we find that the prompt choice significantly affects\nthe calibration in CLIP, where the prompts leading to higher text feature\ndispersion result in better-calibrated predictions. Introducing the Average\nText Feature Dispersion (ATFD), we establish its relationship with calibration\nerror and present a novel method, Calibrated Test-time Prompt Tuning (C-TPT),\nfor optimizing prompts during test-time with enhanced calibration. Through\nextensive experiments on different CLIP architectures and datasets, we show\nthat C-TPT can effectively improve the calibration of test-time prompt tuning\nwithout needing labeled data.

This architecture uniquely combines (1) a small autoregressive model\nand (2) a large model operating in block mode (processing multiple tokens\nsimultaneously). The small model's predictive accuracy is substantially\nenhanced by granting it attention to the large model's richer representations.\nOn the PaLM2 pretraining dataset, a tandem of PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko\ndemonstrates a 3.3% improvement in next-token prediction accuracy over a\nstandalone PaLM2-Gecko, offering a 1.16x speedup compared to a PaLM2-Otter\nmodel with comparable downstream performance.

We\ndemonstrate that the models with the same pre-training loss, but different\nmodel and data sizes, generate the same performance on various downstream\ntasks.

In this work, we show that a simple and\nscalable combination of learning rate (LR) re-warming, LR re-decaying, and\nreplay of previous data is sufficient to match the performance of fully\nre-training from scratch on all available data, as measured by the final loss\nand the average score on several language model (LM) evaluation benchmarks.\nSpecifically, we show this for a weak but realistic distribution shift between\ntwo commonly used LLM pre-training datasets (English$\\rightarrow$English) and a\nstronger distribution shift (English$\\rightarrow$German) at the $405$M\nparameter model scale with large dataset sizes (hundreds of billions of\ntokens). Selecting the weak but realistic shift for larger-scale experiments,\nwe also find that our continual learning strategies match the re-training\nbaseline for a 10B parameter LLM. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can be\nsuccessfully updated via simple and scalable continual learning strategies,\nmatching the re-training baseline using only a fraction of the compute.\nFinally, inspired by previous work, we propose alternatives to the cosine\nlearning rate schedule that help circumvent forgetting induced by LR re-warming\nand that are not bound to a fixed token budget.\n","authors":["Adam Ibrahim","Benjamin Th√©rien","Kshitij Gupta","Mats L.

A circuit is faithful if\nall model edges outside the circuit can be ablated without changing the model's\nperformance on the task; faithfulness is what justifies studying circuits,\nrather than the full model.

While\nspeculative and parallel decoding techniques attempt to mitigate this, they\nface limitations: either relying on less accurate smaller models for generation\nor failing to fully leverage the base LLM's representations.\n  We introduce a novel architecture, Tandem transformers, to address these\nissues. This architecture uniquely combines (1) a small autoregressive model\nand (2) a large model operating in block mode (processing multiple tokens\nsimultaneously). The small model's predictive accuracy is substantially\nenhanced by granting it attention to the large model's richer representations.\nOn the PaLM2 pretraining dataset, a tandem of PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko\ndemonstrates a 3.3% improvement in next-token prediction accuracy over a\nstandalone PaLM2-Gecko, offering a 1.16x speedup compared to a PaLM2-Otter\nmodel with comparable downstream performance. We further incorporate the tandem\nmodel within the speculative decoding (SPEED) framework where the large model\nvalidates tokens from the small model. This ensures that the Tandem of\nPaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko achieves substantial speedup (around 1.14x faster\nthan using vanilla PaLM2-Gecko in SPEED) while maintaining identical downstream\ntask accuracy.\n","authors":["Aishwarya P S","Pranav Ajit Nair","Yashas Samaga","Toby Boyd","Sanjiv Kumar","Prateek Jain","Praneeth Netrapalli"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08644v3.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17599v1","updated":"2024-03-26T11:09:58Z","published":"2024-03-26T11:09:58Z","title":"Coimagining the Future of Voice Assistants with Cultural Sensitivity","summary":"  Voice assistants (VAs) are becoming a feature of our everyday life.

Current solutions to this issue involve altering the probability\ndistribution of candidate words, rendering them incompatible with provably\nsecure steganography. We propose a novel secure disambiguation method named\nSyncPool, which effectively addresses the segmentation ambiguity problem. We\ngroup all tokens with prefix relationships in the candidate pool before the\nsteganographic embedding algorithm runs to eliminate uncertainty among\nambiguous tokens. To enable the receiver to synchronize the sampling process of\nthe sender, a shared cryptographically-secure pseudorandom number generator\n(CSPRNG) is deployed to select a token from the ambiguity pool. SyncPool does\nnot change the size of the candidate pool or the distribution of tokens and\nthus is applicable to provably secure language steganography methods.

This challenge is even more for regional\nBengali dialects due to unavailability of standardized spelling conventions for\nthese dialects, presence of local and foreign words popular in those regions\nand phonological diversity across different regions. This paper presents an\napproach to this sequence-to-sequence problem by introducing the District\nGuided Tokens (DGT) technique on a new dataset spanning six districts of\nBangladesh. The key idea is to provide the model with explicit information\nabout the regional dialect or \"district\" of the input text before generating\nthe IPA transcription. This is achieved by prepending a district token to the\ninput sequence, effectively guiding the model to understand the unique phonetic\npatterns associated with each district. The DGT technique is applied to\nfine-tune several transformer-based models, on this new dataset. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of DGT, with the ByT5 model achieving\nsuperior performance over word-based models like mT5, BanglaT5, and umT5.

TDT systems aim to cluster a corpus of news articles by event,\nand in that context, stories that describe the same event are likely to have\nbeen written at around the same time. Prior work on time modeling for TDT takes\nthis into account, but does not well capture how time interacts with the\nsemantic nature of the event. For example, stories about a tropical storm are\nlikely to be written within a short time interval, while stories about a movie\nrelease may appear over weeks or months. In our work, we design a neural method\nthat fuses temporal and textual information into a single representation of\nnews documents for event detection. We fine-tune these time-aware document\nembeddings with a triplet loss architecture, integrate the model into\ndownstream TDT systems, and evaluate the systems on two benchmark TDT data sets\nin English. In the retrospective setting, we apply clustering algorithms to the\ntime-aware embeddings and show substantial improvements over baselines on the\nNews2013 data set. In the online streaming setting, we add our document encoder\nto an existing state-of-the-art TDT pipeline and demonstrate that it can\nbenefit the overall performance.

Investigating and Mitigating Prompt Bias\n  in Factual Knowledge Extraction","summary":"  Recent research shows that pre-trained language models (PLMs) suffer from\n\"prompt bias\" in factual knowledge extraction, i.e., prompts tend to introduce\nbiases toward specific labels. Prompt bias presents a significant challenge in\nassessing the factual knowledge within PLMs. Therefore, this paper aims to\nimprove the reliability of existing benchmarks by thoroughly investigating and\nmitigating prompt bias. We show that: 1) all prompts in the experiments exhibit\nnon-negligible bias, with gradient-based prompts like AutoPrompt and OptiPrompt\ndisplaying significantly higher levels of bias; 2) prompt bias can amplify\nbenchmark accuracy unreasonably by overfitting the test datasets, especially on\nimbalanced datasets like LAMA. Based on these findings, we propose a\nrepresentation-based approach to mitigate the prompt bias during inference\ntime. Specifically, we first estimate the biased representation using\nprompt-only querying, and then remove it from the model's internal\nrepresentations to generate the debiased representations, which are used to\nproduce the final debiased outputs. Experiments across various prompts, PLMs,\nand benchmarks show that our approach can not only correct the overfitted\nperformance caused by prompt bias, but also significantly improve the prompt\nretrieval capability (up to 10% absolute performance gain). These results\nindicate that our approach effectively alleviates prompt bias in knowledge\nevaluation, thereby enhancing the reliability of benchmark assessments.\nHopefully, our plug-and-play approach can be a golden standard to strengthen\nPLMs toward reliable knowledge bases.

Aiming at improving the zero-shot chain-of-thought\nreasoning ability of large language models, we propose LoT (Logical Thoughts),\na self-improvement prompting framework that leverages principles rooted in\nsymbolic logic, particularly Reductio ad Absurdum, to systematically verify and\nrectify the reasoning processes step by step. Experimental evaluations\nconducted on language tasks in diverse domains, including arithmetic,\ncommonsense, symbolic, causal inference, and social problems, demonstrate the\nefficacy of enhanced reasoning by logic.

In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel methodology named eXplainable Lexicons (XLex) that combines the\nadvantages of both lexicon-based methods and transformer models.

The proposed MCA effectively encodes both\nlocal and global features at various levels of granularity while efficiently\nmaintaining consistent speed regardless of the video length. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple benchmarks, LVOS, Long-Time Video, and DAVIS 2017,\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed contributions leading to\nreal-time inference and markedly reduced memory demands without any degradation\nin segmentation accuracy on long videos. Compared to the best existing\ntransformer-based approach, our MAVOS increases the speed by 7.6x, while\nsignificantly reducing the GPU memory by 87% with comparable segmentation\nperformance on short and long video datasets. Notably on the LVOS dataset, our\nMAVOS achieves a J&F score of 63.3% while operating at 37 frames per second\n(FPS) on a single V100 GPU.

From calculating biomarkers such as ejection\nfraction to the probability of a patient's heart failure, accurate segmentation\nof the heart structures allows doctors to assess the heart's condition and\ndevise treatments with greater precision and accuracy. However, achieving\naccurate and reliable left ventricle segmentation is time-consuming and\nchallenging due to different reasons. Hence, clinicians often rely on\nsegmenting the left ventricular (LV) in two specific echocardiogram frames to\nmake a diagnosis.

In\nresponse to this challenge, this work introduces SimLVSeg, a novel paradigm\nthat enables video-based networks for consistent LV segmentation from sparsely\nannotated echocardiogram videos. SimLVSeg consists of self-supervised\npre-training with temporal masking, followed by weakly supervised learning\ntailored for LV segmentation from sparse annotations.

Traditional\nmethods for data copyright protection are applied prior to data distribution,\nimplying that models trained on these data become uncontrollable. This paper\nintroduces a novel approach, named DataCook, designed to safeguard the\ncopyright of healthcare data during the deployment phase. DataCook operates by\n\"cooking\" the raw data before distribution, enabling the development of models\nthat perform normally on this processed data. However, during the deployment\nphase, the original test data must be also \"cooked\" through DataCook to ensure\nnormal model performance. This process grants copyright holders control over\nauthorization during the deployment phase. The mechanism behind DataCook is by\ncrafting anti-adversarial examples (AntiAdv), which are designed to enhance\nmodel confidence, as opposed to standard adversarial examples (Adv) that aim to\nconfuse models. Similar to Adv, AntiAdv introduces imperceptible perturbations,\nensuring that the data processed by DataCook remains easily understandable.

However, we identify two key\nlimitations in a conventional label assignment for training Transformer-based\nVRD models, which is a process of mapping a ground-truth (GT) to a prediction.\nUnder the conventional assignment, an unspecialized query is trained since a\nquery is expected to detect every relation, which makes it difficult for a\nquery to specialize in specific relations. Furthermore, a query is also\ninsufficiently trained since a GT is assigned only to a single prediction,\ntherefore near-correct or even correct predictions are suppressed by being\nassigned no relation as a GT. To address these issues, we propose Groupwise\nQuery Specialization and Quality-Aware Multi-Assignment (SpeaQ). Groupwise\nQuery Specialization trains a specialized query by dividing queries and\nrelations into disjoint groups and directing a query in a specific query group\nsolely toward relations in the corresponding relation group. Quality-Aware\nMulti-Assignment further facilitates the training by assigning a GT to multiple\npredictions that are significantly close to a GT in terms of a subject, an\nobject, and the relation in between.

This practice is widely\nregarded as secure, even in cases where some annotated errors occur, as the\nimpact of these minor inaccuracies on the final performance of the models is\nnegligible and existing backdoor attacks require attacker's ability to poison\nthe training images. Nevertheless, in this paper, we propose clean-image\nbackdoor attacks which uncover that backdoors can still be injected via a\nfraction of incorrect labels without modifying the training images.\nSpecifically, in our attacks, the attacker first seeks a trigger feature to\ndivide the training images into two parts: those with the feature and those\nwithout it. Subsequently, the attacker falsifies the labels of the former part\nto a backdoor class. The backdoor will be finally implanted into the target\nmodel after it is trained on the poisoned data. During the inference phase, the\nattacker can activate the backdoor in two ways: slightly modifying the input\nimage to obtain the trigger feature, or taking an image that naturally has the\ntrigger feature as input. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the\neffectiveness and practicality of our attacks. According to the experimental\nresults, we conclude that our attacks seriously jeopardize the fairness and\nrobustness of image classification models, and it is necessary to be vigilant\nabout the incorrect labels in outsourced labeling.\n","authors":["Dazhong Rong","Guoyao Yu","Shuheng Shen","Xinyi Fu","Peng Qian","Jianhai Chen","Qinming He","Xing Fu","Weiqiang Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15010v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06683v2","updated":"2024-03-26T12:10:13Z","published":"2024-03-11T12:57:51Z","title":"Transferring Relative Monocular Depth to Surgical Vision with Temporal\n  Consistency","summary":"  Relative monocular depth, inferring depth up to shift and scale from a single\nimage, is an active research topic.

To achieve this goal, we\npropose an iterative object identification (IOI) module, which can recognize\nsound-making objects in an iterative manner.

However, adversarial prompts known as\n'jailbreaks' can circumvent safeguards, leading LLMs to generate potentially\nharmful content. Exploring jailbreak prompts can help to better reveal the\nweaknesses of LLMs and further steer us to secure them. Unfortunately, existing\njailbreak methods either suffer from intricate manual design or require\noptimization on other white-box models, which compromises either generalization\nor efficiency. In this paper, we generalize jailbreak prompt attacks into two\naspects: (1) Prompt Rewriting and (2) Scenario Nesting. Based on this, we\npropose ReNeLLM, an automatic framework that leverages LLMs themselves to\ngenerate effective jailbreak prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nReNeLLM significantly improves the attack success rate while greatly reducing\nthe time cost compared to existing baselines.

A prominent strategy involves Video Language Models\n(VideoLMs), which train a learnable interface with video data to connect\nadvanced vision encoders with LLMs. Recently, an alternative strategy has\nsurfaced, employing readily available foundation models, such as VideoLMs and\nLLMs, across multiple stages for modality bridging. In this study, we introduce\na simple yet novel strategy where only a single Vision Language Model (VLM) is\nutilized. Our starting point is the plain insight that a video comprises a\nseries of images, or frames, interwoven with temporal information. The essence\nof video comprehension lies in adeptly managing the temporal aspects along with\nthe spatial details of each frame. Initially, we transform a video into a\nsingle composite image by arranging multiple frames in a grid layout. The\nresulting single image is termed as an image grid. This format, while\nmaintaining the appearance of a solitary image, effectively retains temporal\ninformation within the grid structure. Therefore, the image grid approach\nenables direct application of a single high-performance VLM without\nnecessitating any video-data training.

The main\nchallenges are the lack of observations and the inherent ambiguities of the\nsetting, e.g. occlusions and depth ambiguity. As a result, radiance fields,\nwhich have shown great promise in capturing high-frequency appearance and\ngeometry details in dense setups, perform poorly when na\\\"ively supervising\nthem on sparse camera views, as the field simply overfits to the sparse-view\ninputs. To address this, we propose MetaCap, a method for efficient and\nhigh-quality geometry recovery and novel view synthesis given very sparse or\neven a single view of the human. Our key idea is to meta-learn the radiance\nfield weights solely from potentially sparse multi-view videos, which can serve\nas a prior when fine-tuning them on sparse imagery depicting the human. This\nprior provides a good network weight initialization, thereby effectively\naddressing ambiguities in sparse-view capture. Due to the articulated structure\nof the human body and motion-induced surface deformations, learning such a\nprior is non-trivial. Therefore, we propose to meta-learn the field weights in\na pose-canonicalized space, which reduces the spatial feature range and makes\nfeature learning more effective. Consequently, one can fine-tune our field\nparameters to quickly generalize to unseen poses, novel illumination conditions\nas well as novel and sparse (even monocular) camera views.

To solve image\nrestoration problems, many existing techniques achieve data consistency by\nincorporating additional likelihood gradient steps into the reverse sampling\nprocess of diffusion models. However, the additional gradient steps pose a\nchallenge for real-world practical applications as they incur a large\ncomputational overhead, thereby increasing inference time. They also present\nadditional difficulties when using accelerated diffusion model samplers, as the\nnumber of data consistency steps is limited by the number of reverse sampling\nsteps. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based image restoration\nsolver that addresses these issues by decoupling the reverse process from the\ndata consistency steps. Our method involves alternating between a\nreconstruction phase to maintain data consistency and a refinement phase that\nenforces the prior via diffusion purification. Our approach demonstrates\nversatility, making it highly adaptable for efficient problem-solving in latent\nspace.

One key factor of the\ngreat comprehension power of the large language model is that natural language\ntokenizers utilize meaningful words or subwords as the basic elements of\nlanguage. In contrast, mainstream visual tokenizers, represented by patch-based\nmethods such as Patch Embed, rely on meaningless rectangular patches as basic\nelements of vision, which cannot serve as effectively as words or subwords in\nlanguage. Starting from the essence of the tokenizer, we defined semantically\nindependent regions (SIRs) for vision. We designed a simple HOmogeneous visual\ntOKenizer: HOOK. HOOK mainly consists of two modules: the Object Perception\nModule (OPM) and the Object Vectorization Module (OVM). To achieve homogeneity,\nthe OPM splits the image into 4*4 pixel seeds and then utilizes the attention\nmechanism to perceive SIRs. The OVM employs cross-attention to merge seeds\nwithin the same SIR.

Unfortunately, the energy consumption\nand decision latency are not robust against adversaries. Researchers have\nrecently demonstrated that attackers can compute and submit so-called sponge\nexamples at inference time to increase the energy consumption and decision\nlatency of neural networks. In computer vision, the proposed strategy crafts\ninputs with less activation sparsity which could otherwise be used to\naccelerate the computation. In this paper, we analyze the mechanism how these\nenergy-latency attacks reduce activation sparsity. In particular, we find that\ninput uniformity is a key enabler.

Most\nmethods maintain consistent predictions of the unlabeled images under\nvariations (e.g., adding noise/perturbations, or creating alternative versions)\nin the image and/or model level. In most image-level variation, medical images\noften have prior structure information, which has not been well explored. In\nthis paper, we propose novel dual structure-aware image filterings (DSAIF) as\nthe image-level variations for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.\nMotivated by connected filtering that simplifies image via filtering in\nstructure-aware tree-based image representation, we resort to the dual contrast\ninvariant Max-tree and Min-tree representation. Specifically, we propose a\nnovel connected filtering that removes topologically equivalent nodes (i.e.\nconnected components) having no siblings in the Max/Min-tree. This results in\ntwo filtered images preserving topologically critical structure.

Our empirical\nexperiments underscore the persistence of this bias, as LVLMs often provide\nconfident answers even in the absence of relevant images or given incongruent\nvisual input. To rectify these biases and redirect the model's focus toward\nvision information, we introduce two simple, training-free strategies.
