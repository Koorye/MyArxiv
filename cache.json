However, in practice,\ntransformers' reasoning can be improved by allowing them to use a \"chain of\nthought\" or \"scratchpad\", i.e., generate and condition on a sequence of\nintermediate tokens before answering. Motivated by this, we ask: Does such\nintermediate generation fundamentally extend the computational power of a\ndecoder-only transformer? We show that the answer is yes, but the amount of\nincrease depends crucially on the amount of intermediate generation. For\ninstance, we find that transformer decoders with a logarithmic number of\ndecoding steps (w.r.t. the input length) push the limits of standard\ntransformers only slightly, while a linear number of decoding steps, assuming a\nslight generalization to standard pre-norm, adds a clear new ability (under\nstandard complexity conjectures): recognizing all regular languages. Our\nresults also imply that linear steps keep transformer decoders within\ncontext-sensitive languages, and polynomial steps with generalized pre-norm\nmake them recognize exactly the class of polynomial-time solvable problems --\nthe first exact characterization of a type of transformers in terms of standard\ncomplexity classes.

In this paper, we introduce RoleInteract,\nthe first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the sociality of\nrole-playing conversational agents at both individual and group levels of\nsocial interactions. The benchmark is constructed from a variety of sources and\ncovers a wide range of 500 characters and over 6,000 question prompts and\n30,800 multi-turn role-playing utterances. We conduct comprehensive evaluations\non this benchmark using mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs. We find\nthat agents excelling in individual level does not imply their proficiency in\ngroup level. Moreover, the behavior of individuals may drift as a result of the\ninfluence exerted by other agents within the group. Experimental results on\nRoleInteract confirm its significance as a testbed for assessing the social\ninteraction of role-playing conversational agents.

It is a typical example that the model knows \"A's father is\nB\", but is unable to reason \"B's child is A\". This limitation poses a challenge\nto the advancement of artificial general intelligence (AGI), as it suggests a\ngap in the models' ability to comprehend and apply bidirectional reasoning. In\nthis paper, we first conduct substantial evaluation and identify that the root\ncause of the reversal curse lies in the different word order between the\ntraining and inference stage, namely, the poor ability of causal language\nmodels to predict antecedent words within the training data. Accordingly,\npermutation on the training data is considered as a potential solution, since\nthis can make the model predict antecedent words or tokens. However, previous\npermutation methods may disrupt complete phrases or entities, thereby posing\nchallenges for the model to comprehend and learn from training data. To address\nthis issue, we propose Semantic-aware Permutation Training (SPT), which\naddresses this issue by segmenting the training sentences into semantic units\n(i.e., entities or phrases) with an assistant language model and permuting\nthese units before feeding into the model.

Recent advances in sequence modeling have sparked\ninterest in learning user embeddings from behavioral data. Yet behavior-based\nuser embedding learning faces the unique challenge of dynamic user modeling. As\nusers continuously interact with the apps, user embeddings should be\nperiodically updated to account for users' recent and long-term behavior\npatterns. Existing methods highly rely on stateless sequence models that lack\nmemory of historical behavior. They have to either discard historical data and\nuse only the most recent data or reprocess the old and new data jointly. Both\ncases incur substantial computational overhead. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce User Stateful Embedding (USE). USE generates user embeddings and\nreflects users' evolving behaviors without the need for exhaustive reprocessing\nby storing previous model states and revisiting them in the future.\nFurthermore, we introduce a novel training objective named future W-behavior\nprediction to transcend the limitations of next-token prediction by forecasting\na broader horizon of upcoming user behaviors.

However,\nour analysis also suggests that there is no statistical reason that pretraining\nwill lead to hallucination on facts that tend to appear more than once in the\ntraining data (like references to publications such as articles and books,\nwhose hallucinations have been particularly notable and problematic) or on\nsystematic facts (like arithmetic calculations). Therefore, different\narchitectures and learning algorithms may mitigate these latter types of\nhallucinations.\n","authors":["Adam Tauman Kalai","Santosh S.

To train TSMMG, we construct a large set of\ntext-molecule pairs by extracting molecular knowledge from these 'teachers',\nenabling it to generate novel molecules that conform to the descriptions\nthrough various text prompts. We experimentally show that TSMMG remarkably\nperforms in generating molecules meeting complex, natural language-described\nproperty requirements across two-, three-, and four-constraint tasks, with an\naverage molecular validity of over 99% and success ratio of 88.08%, 65.27%, and\n61.44%, respectively. The model also exhibits adaptability through zero-shot\ntesting, creating molecules that satisfy combinations of properties that have\nnot been encountered. It can comprehend text inputs with various language\nstyles, extending beyond the confines of outlined prompts, as confirmed through\nempirical validation. Additionally, the knowledge distillation feature of TSMMG\ncontributes to the continuous enhancement of small models, while the innovative\napproach to dataset construction effectively addresses the issues of data\nscarcity and quality, which positions TSMMG as a promising tool in the domains\nof drug discovery and materials science.

To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel\ninference method, Prompt Highlighter, which enables users to highlight specific\nprompt spans to interactively control the focus during generation. Motivated by\nthe classifier-free diffusion guidance, we form regular and unconditional\ncontext pairs based on highlighted tokens, demonstrating that the\nautoregressive generation in models can be guided in a classifier-free way.\nNotably, we find that, during inference, guiding the models with highlighted\ntokens through the attention weights leads to more desired outputs.

The Misleading Success of\n  Simulating Social Interactions With LLMs","summary":"  Recent advances in large language models (LLM) have enabled richer social\nsimulations, allowing for the study of various social phenomena with LLM-based\nagents. However, most work has used an omniscient perspective on these\nsimulations (e.g., single LLM to generate all interlocutors), which is\nfundamentally at odds with the non-omniscient, information asymmetric\ninteractions that humans have. To examine these differences, we develop an\nevaluation framework to simulate social interactions with LLMs in various\nsettings (omniscient, non-omniscient). Our experiments show that interlocutors\nsimulated omnisciently are much more successful at accomplishing social goals\ncompared to non-omniscient agents, despite the latter being the more realistic\nsetting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that learning from omniscient simulations\nimproves the apparent naturalness of interactions but scarcely enhances goal\nachievement in cooperative scenarios. Our findings indicate that addressing\ninformation asymmetry remains a fundamental challenge for LLM-based agents.\n","authors":["Xuhui Zhou","Zhe Su","Tiwalayo Eisape","Hyunwoo Kim","Maarten Sap"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.05020v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05342v4","updated":"2024-03-20T20:37:17Z","published":"2023-08-10T05:10:17Z","title":"Metacognitive Prompting Improves Understanding in Large Language Models","summary":"  In Large Language Models (LLMs), there have been consistent advancements in\ntask-specific performance, largely influenced by effective prompt design.\nRecent advancements in prompting have enhanced reasoning in logic-intensive\ntasks for LLMs, yet the nuanced understanding abilities of these models,\ncrucial for processing and interpreting complex information, remain\nunderexplored.

The expanding variety of\nPre-Trained VLMs enhances the likelihood of identifying a suitable VLM for\nspecific tasks. Thus, a promising zero-shot image classification strategy is\nselecting the most appropriate Pre-Trained VLM from the VLM Zoo, relying solely\non the text data of the target dataset without access to the dataset's images.\nIn this paper, we analyze two inherent challenges in assessing the ability of a\nVLM in this Language-Only VLM selection: the \"Modality Gap\" -- the disparity in\nVLM's embeddings across two different modalities, making text a less reliable\nsubstitute for images; and the \"Capability Gap\" -- the discrepancy between the\nVLM's overall ranking and its ranking for target dataset, hindering direct\nprediction of a model's dataset-specific performance from its general\nperformance.

This process encourages the model to\nidentify and learn patterns within the source video, as well as bridging the\ngap between standard generative processes and outpainting. The subsequent\nphase, pattern-aware outpainting, is dedicated to the generalization of these\nlearned patterns to generate outpainting outcomes. Additional strategies\nincluding spatial-aware insertion and noise travel are proposed to better\nleverage the diffusion model's generative prior and the acquired video patterns\nfrom source videos. Extensive evaluations underscore MOTIA's superiority,\noutperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in widely recognized\nbenchmarks.

Unfortunately,\noptical imaging is vulnerable to image degradation due to laser scattering and\nabsorption, which can result in diagnostic errors and misguided treatment.\nRestoration of optical images is a challenging computer vision task because the\nsources of image degradation are multi-factorial, stochastic, and\ntissue-dependent, preventing a straightforward method to obtain paired\nlow-quality/high-quality data. Here, we present Restorative Step-Calibrated\nDiffusion (RSCD), an unpaired image restoration method that views the image\nrestoration problem as completing the finishing steps of a diffusion-based\nimage generation task. RSCD uses a step calibrator model to dynamically\ndetermine the severity of image degradation and the number of steps required to\ncomplete the reverse diffusion process for image restoration. RSCD outperforms\nother widely used unpaired image restoration methods on both image quality and\nperceptual evaluation metrics for restoring optical images. Medical imaging\nexperts consistently prefer images restored using RSCD in blinded comparison\nexperiments and report minimal to no hallucinations. Finally, we show that RSCD\nimproves performance on downstream clinical imaging tasks, including automated\nbrain tumor diagnosis and deep tissue imaging.

Such privacy effects are often\nmeasured by membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to identify whether\na particular example belongs to the training set or not. We propose to\ninvestigate privacy from a new perspective called memorization. Through the\nlens of memorization, we find that previously deployed MIAs produce misleading\nresults as they are less likely to identify samples with higher privacy risks\nas members compared to samples with low privacy risks. To solve this problem,\nwe deploy a recent attack that can capture individual samples' memorization\ndegrees for evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we unveil several\nfindings about the connections between three essential properties of machine\nlearning models, including privacy, generalization gap, and adversarial\nrobustness. We demonstrate that the generalization gap and privacy leakage are\nless correlated than those of the previous results. Moreover, there is not\nnecessarily a trade-off between adversarial robustness and privacy as stronger\nadversarial robustness does not make the model more susceptible to privacy\nattacks.\n","authors":["Xiao Li","Qiongxiu Li","Zhanhao Hu","Xiaolin Hu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08270v3.pdf","comment":"Accepted by IEEE TIFS, 17 pages"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12425v2","updated":"2024-03-20T13:56:56Z","published":"2024-03-19T04:25:54Z","title":"Multimodal Fusion Method with Spatiotemporal Sequences and Relationship\n  Learning for Valence-Arousal Estimation","summary":"  This paper presents our approach for the VA (Valence-Arousal) estimation task\nin the ABAW6 competition.

Our research\naddresses the shortfall by introducing a novel approach to VAC, called\nIrregular Video Action Counting (IVAC). IVAC prioritizes modeling irregular\nrepetition patterns in videos, which we define through two primary aspects:\nInter-cycle Consistency and Cycle-interval Inconsistency.

In this paper, we argue that\nexisting logit-based methods may be sub-optimal since they only leverage the\nglobal logit output that couples multiple semantic knowledge. This may transfer\nambiguous knowledge to the student and mislead its learning. To this end, we\npropose a simple but effective method, i.e., Scale Decoupled Distillation\n(SDD), for logit knowledge distillation. SDD decouples the global logit output\ninto multiple local logit outputs and establishes distillation pipelines for\nthem.

Moreover, the decoupled knowledge can be further divided into\nconsistent and complementary logit knowledge that transfers the semantic\ninformation and sample ambiguity, respectively. By increasing the weight of\ncomplementary parts, SDD can guide the student to focus more on ambiguous\nsamples, improving its discrimination ability.

This challenge lies\nin the lack of clear separation between content and style of a motion. To\ntackle this challenge, we propose a novel motion style transformer that\neffectively disentangles style from content and generates a plausible motion\nwith transferred style from a source motion. Our distinctive approach to\nachieving the goal of disentanglement is twofold: (1) a new architecture for\nmotion style transformer with `part-attentive style modulator across body\nparts' and `Siamese encoders that encode style and content features\nseparately'; (2) style disentanglement loss.

Previous works adopt the conventional\nclassification architecture, which consists of a feature extractor and a\nclassifier. The feature extractor is shared across sequentially arrived tasks\nor classes, but one specific group of weights of the classifier corresponding\nto one new class should be incrementally expanded. Consequently, the parameters\nof a continual learner gradually increase. Moreover, as the classifier contains\nall historical arrived classes, a certain size of the memory is usually\nrequired to store rehearsal data to mitigate classifier bias and catastrophic\nforgetting. In this paper, we propose a non-incremental learner, named\nAttriCLIP, to incrementally extract knowledge of new classes or tasks.\nSpecifically, AttriCLIP is built upon the pre-trained visual-language model\nCLIP. Its image encoder and text encoder are fixed to extract features from\nboth images and text. Text consists of a category name and a fixed number of\nlearnable parameters which are selected from our designed attribute word bank\nand serve as attributes. As we compute the visual and textual similarity for\nclassification, AttriCLIP is a non-incremental learner. The attribute prompts,\nwhich encode the common knowledge useful for classification, can effectively\nmitigate the catastrophic forgetting and avoid constructing a replay memory. We\nevaluate our AttriCLIP and compare it with CLIP-based and previous\nstate-of-the-art continual learning methods in realistic settings with\ndomain-shift and long-sequence learning. The results show that our method\nperforms favorably against previous state-of-the-arts.

Unfortunately, synthesizing novel views remains to be a\nchallenge for input views with heterogeneous brightness level captured under\nlow-light condition. The condition is pretty common in the real world. It\ncauses low-contrast images where details are concealed in the darkness and\ncamera sensor noise significantly degrades the image quality. To tackle this\nproblem, we propose to learn to decompose illumination, reflectance, and noise\nfrom input views according to that reflectance remains invariant across\nheterogeneous views. To cope with heterogeneous brightness and noise levels\nacross multi-views, we learn an illumination embedding and optimize a noise map\nindividually for each view. To allow intuitive editing of the illumination, we\ndesign an illumination adjustment module to enable either brightening or\ndarkening of the illumination component.

We point out that MiO\nIR faces two pivotal challenges: the optimization of diverse objectives and the\nadaptation to multiple tasks. To tackle these challenges, we present two simple\nyet effective strategies. The first strategy, referred to as sequential\nlearning, attempts to address how to optimize the diverse objectives, which\nguides the network to incrementally learn individual IR tasks in a sequential\nmanner rather than mixing them together.

Recently, efforts have been made to train\nlanguage agents for performance improvement, with multi-step reasoning and\naction trajectories as the training data. However, collecting such trajectories\nstill requires considerable human effort, by either artificial annotations or\nimplementations of diverse prompting frameworks. In this work, we propose\nA$^3$T, a framework that enables the Autonomous Annotation of Agent\nTrajectories in the style of ReAct. The central role is an ActRe prompting\nagent, which explains the reason for an arbitrary action. When randomly\nsampling an external action, the ReAct-style agent could query the ActRe agent\nwith the action to obtain its textual rationales. Novel trajectories are then\nsynthesized by prepending the posterior reasoning from ActRe to the sampled\naction. In this way, the ReAct-style agent executes multiple trajectories for\nthe failed tasks, and selects the successful ones to supplement its failed\ntrajectory for contrastive self-training. Realized by policy gradient methods\nwith binarized rewards, the contrastive self-training with accumulated\ntrajectories facilitates a closed loop for multiple rounds of language agent\nself-improvement. We conduct experiments using QLoRA fine-tuning with the\nopen-sourced Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2. In AlfWorld, the agent trained with\nA$^3$T obtains a 1-shot success rate of 96%, and 100% success with 4 iterative\nrounds. In WebShop, the 1-shot performance of the A$^3$T agent matches human\naverage, and 4 rounds of iterative refinement lead to the performance\napproaching human experts.

In this paper, instead of discarding low-quality\nsamples, we propose CoachLM, a novel approach to enhance the quality of\ninstruction datasets through automatic revisions on samples in the dataset.\nCoachLM is trained from the samples revised by human experts and significantly\nincreases the proportion of high-quality samples in the dataset from 17.7% to\n78.9%. The effectiveness of CoachLM is further assessed on various real-world\ninstruction test sets. The results show that CoachLM improves the\ninstruction-following capabilities of the instruction-tuned LLM by an average\nof 29.9%, which even surpasses larger LLMs with nearly twice the number of\nparameters. Furthermore, CoachLM is successfully deployed in a data management\nsystem for LLMs at Huawei, resulting in an efficiency improvement of up to 20%\nin the cleaning of 40k real-world instruction pairs. We release various assets\nof CoachLM, including the training data, code and test set\n(https://github.com/lunyiliu/CoachLM).\n","authors":["Yilun Liu","Shimin Tao","Xiaofeng Zhao","Ming Zhu","Wenbing Ma","Junhao Zhu","Chang Su","Yutai Hou","Miao Zhang","Min Zhang","Hongxia Ma","Li Zhang","Hao Yang","Yanfei Jiang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.13246v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted by ICDE 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13257v2","updated":"2024-03-21T03:13:30Z","published":"2024-03-20T02:38:01Z","title":"Arcee's MergeKit: A Toolkit for Merging Large Language Models","summary":"  The rapid expansion of the open-source language model landscape presents an\nopportunity to merge the competencies of these model checkpoints by combining\ntheir parameters.

There are two major limitations of previous video-language alignment\napproaches. First, they do not capture both short-range and long-range temporal\ndependencies and typically employ complex hierarchical deep network\narchitectures that are hard to integrate with existing pretrained image-text\nfoundation models. To effectively address this limitation, we instead keep the\nnetwork architecture simple and use a set of data tokens that operate at\ndifferent temporal resolutions in a hierarchical manner, accounting for the\ntemporally hierarchical nature of videos. By employing a simple two-tower\narchitecture, we are able to initialize our video-language model with\npretrained image-text foundation models, thereby boosting the final\nperformance. Second, existing video-language alignment works struggle due to\nthe lack of semantically aligned large-scale training data. To overcome it, we\nleverage recent LLMs to curate the largest video-language dataset to date with\nbetter visual grounding. Furthermore, unlike existing video-text datasets which\nonly contain short clips, our dataset is enriched with video clips of varying\ndurations to aid our temporally hierarchical data tokens in extracting better\nrepresentations at varying temporal scales. Overall, empirical results show\nthat our proposed approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on multiple\nretrieval benchmarks, especially on longer videos, and performs competitively\non classification benchmarks.\n","authors":["Mamshad Nayeem Rizve","Fan Fei","Jayakrishnan Unnikrishnan","Son Tran","Benjamin Z.

The key components\nare:(i) a short-term memory block called conditional attention module (CAM),\nwhich conditions the current generation on the features extracted from the\nprevious chunk via an attentional mechanism, leading to consistent chunk\ntransitions, (ii) a long-term memory block called appearance preservation\nmodule, which extracts high-level scene and object features from the first\nvideo chunk to prevent the model from forgetting the initial scene, and (iii) a\nrandomized blending approach that enables to apply a video enhancer\nautoregressively for infinitely long videos without inconsistencies between\nchunks.

This approach allows MathVerse to comprehensively assess whether and how\nmuch MLLMs can truly understand the visual diagrams for mathematical reasoning.\nIn addition, we propose a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation strategy for a\nfine-grained assessment of the output answers. Rather than naively judging True\nor False, we employ GPT-4(V) to adaptively extract crucial reasoning steps, and\nthen score each step with detailed error analysis, which can reveal the\nintermediate CoT reasoning quality by MLLMs. We hope the MathVerse benchmark\nmay provide unique insights to guide the future development of MLLMs. Project\npage: https://mathverse-cuhk.github.io\n","authors":["Renrui Zhang","Dongzhi Jiang","Yichi Zhang","Haokun Lin","Ziyu Guo","Pengshuo Qiu","Aojun Zhou","Pan Lu","Kai-Wei Chang","Peng Gao","Hongsheng Li"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14624v1.pdf","comment":"46 Pages, Work in Progress, Benchmark Project Page:\n  https://mathverse-cuhk.github.io"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14623v1","updated":"2024-03-21T17:59:41Z","published":"2024-03-21T17:59:41Z","title":"Simplified Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge","summary":"  This paper introduces a novel theoretical simplification of the Diffusion\nSchr\\\"odinger Bridge (DSB) that facilitates its unification with Score-based\nGenerative Models (SGMs), addressing the limitations of DSB in complex data\ngeneration and enabling faster convergence and enhanced performance.

These degradations typically\narise from the inherent limitations of cameras or unfavorable ambient\nconditions. To recover clean images from degraded versions, numerous\nspecialized restoration methods have been developed, each targeting a specific\ntype of degradation. Recently, all-in-one algorithms have garnered significant\nattention by addressing different types of degradations within a single model\nwithout requiring prior information of the input degradation type. However,\nthese methods purely operate in the spatial domain and do not delve into the\ndistinct frequency variations inherent to different degradation types. To\naddress this gap, we propose an adaptive all-in-one image restoration network\nbased on frequency mining and modulation. Our approach is motivated by the\nobservation that different degradation types impact the image content on\ndifferent frequency subbands, thereby requiring different treatments for each\nrestoration task. Specifically, we first mine low- and high-frequency\ninformation from the input features, guided by the adaptively decoupled spectra\nof the degraded image. The extracted features are then modulated by a\nbidirectional operator to facilitate interactions between different frequency\ncomponents. Finally, the modulated features are merged into the original input\nfor a progressively guided restoration. With this approach, the model achieves\nadaptive reconstruction by accentuating the informative frequency subbands\naccording to different input degradations. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on different\nimage restoration tasks, including denoising, dehazing, deraining, motion\ndeblurring, and low-light image enhancement.

In the first stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing\nimage editing tools to support an extensive array of video editing tasks.\nBeyond the traditional prompt-based editing methods, AnyV2V also can support\nnovel video editing tasks, including reference-based style transfer,\nsubject-driven editing, and identity manipulation, which were unattainable by\nprevious methods. In the second stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing\nimage-to-video models to perform DDIM inversion and intermediate feature\ninjection to maintain the appearance and motion consistency with the source\nvideo. On the prompt-based editing, we show that AnyV2V can outperform the\nprevious best approach by 35\\% on prompt alignment, and 25\\% on human\npreference. On the three novel tasks, we show that AnyV2V also achieves a high\nsuccess rate. We believe AnyV2V will continue to thrive due to its ability to\nseamlessly integrate the fast-evolving image editing methods. Such\ncompatibility can help AnyV2V to increase its versatility to cater to diverse\nuser demands.\n","authors":["Max Ku","Cong Wei","Weiming Ren","Huan Yang","Wenhu Chen"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14468v1.pdf","comment":"preprint"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14465v1","updated":"2024-03-21T15:13:36Z","published":"2024-03-21T15:13:36Z","title":"CathFlow: Self-Supervised Segmentation of Catheters in Interventional\n  Ultrasound Using Optical Flow and Transformers","summary":"  In minimally invasive endovascular procedures, contrast-enhanced angiography\nremains the most robust imaging technique.

Additionally, interventional radiologists must undergo extensive\ntraining before they become qualified to diagnose and treat patients\neffectively, leading to a shortage of staff, and a lack of open-source\ndatasets. In this work, we seek to address both problems by introducing a\nself-supervised deep learning architecture to segment catheters in longitudinal\nultrasound images, without demanding any labeled data. The network architecture\nbuilds upon AiAReSeg, a segmentation transformer built with the Attention in\nAttention mechanism, and is capable of learning feature changes across time and\nspace. To facilitate training, we used synthetic ultrasound data based on\nphysics-driven catheter insertion simulations, and translated the data into a\nunique CT-Ultrasound common domain, CACTUSS, to improve the segmentation\nperformance.

Our \\emph{differentially private retrieval-augmented\ndiffusion model} (DP-RDM) requires no fine-tuning on the retrieval dataset to\nadapt to another domain, and can use state-of-the-art generative models to\ngenerate high-quality image samples while satisfying rigorous DP guarantees.\nFor instance, when evaluated on MS-COCO, our DP-RDM can generate samples with a\nprivacy budget of $\\epsilon=10$, while providing a $3.5$ point improvement in\nFID compared to public-only retrieval for up to $10,000$ queries.\n","authors":["Jonathan Lebensold","Maziar Sanjabi","Pietro Astolfi","Adriana Romero-Soriano","Kamalika Chaudhuri","Mike Rabbat","Chuan Guo"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14421v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15583v7","updated":"2024-03-21T14:16:39Z","published":"2023-05-24T21:39:27Z","title":"Alleviating Exposure Bias in Diffusion Models through Sampling with\n  Shifted Time Steps","summary":"  Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPM) have shown remarkable efficacy in the\nsynthesis of high-quality images. However, their inference process\ncharacteristically requires numerous, potentially hundreds, of iterative steps,\nwhich could exaggerate the problem of exposure bias due to the training and\ninference discrepancy. Previous work has attempted to mitigate this issue by\nperturbing inputs during training, which consequently mandates the retraining\nof the DPM. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of exposure bias in DPM\nand, intriguingly, we find that the exposure bias could be alleviated with a\nnovel sampling method that we propose, without retraining the model. We\nempirically and theoretically show that, during inference, for each backward\ntime step $t$ and corresponding state $\\hat{x}_t$, there might exist another\ntime step $t_s$ which exhibits superior coupling with $\\hat{x}_t$. Based on\nthis finding, we introduce a sampling method named Time-Shift Sampler. Our\nframework can be seamlessly integrated to existing sampling algorithms, such as\nDDPM, DDIM and other high-order solvers, inducing merely minimal additional\ncomputations. Experimental results show our method brings significant and\nconsistent improvements in FID scores on different datasets and sampling\nmethods. For example, integrating Time-Shift Sampler to F-PNDM yields a\nFID=3.88, achieving 44.49\\% improvements as compared to F-PNDM, on CIFAR-10\nwith 10 sampling steps, which is more performant than the vanilla DDIM with 100\nsampling steps.

Although larger CNNs generally exhibit higher accuracy,\ntheir size can be effectively reduced by \"tensorization\" while maintaining\naccuracy. Tensorization consists of replacing the convolution kernels with\ncompact decompositions such as Tucker, Canonical Polyadic decompositions, or\nquantum-inspired decompositions such as matrix product states, and directly\ntraining the factors in the decompositions to bias the learning towards\nlow-rank decompositions. But why doesn't tensorization seem to impact the\naccuracy adversely? We explore this by assessing how truncating the convolution\nkernels of dense (untensorized) CNNs impact their accuracy. Specifically, we\ntruncated the kernels of (i) a vanilla four-layer CNN and (ii) ResNet-50\npre-trained for image classification on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. We\nfound that kernels (especially those inside deeper layers) could often be\ntruncated along several cuts resulting in significant loss in kernel norm but\nnot in classification accuracy. This suggests that such ``correlation\ncompression'' (underlying tensorization) is an intrinsic feature of how\ninformation is encoded in dense CNNs. We also found that aggressively truncated\nmodels could often recover the pre-truncation accuracy after only a few epochs\nof re-training, suggesting that compressing the internal correlations of\nconvolution layers does not often transport the model to a worse minimum.

In response to these issues, we present NocPlace, which\nleverages generative and inherited knowledge transfer to embed resilience\nagainst dazzling lights and extreme darkness in the global descriptor. First,\nwe establish a day-night urban scene dataset called NightCities, capturing\ndiverse lighting variations and dark scenarios across 60 cities globally.

Finally, VPR models\nare fine-tuned using descriptors inherited from themselves and night-style\nimages, which builds explicit cross-domain contrastive relationships.\nComprehensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate our contributions and\nthe superiority of NocPlace.

In this paper, we propose a\nsimple yet powerful pipeline to reduce the artifact patterns of fake images\nwithout hurting image quality by performing implicit spatial-domain notch\nfiltering.

Recent LMMs incorporate more\ncomplex visual inputs, such as high-resolution images and videos, which\nincrease the number of visual tokens significantly. However, due to the design\nof the Transformer architecture, computational costs associated with these\nmodels tend to increase quadratically with the number of input tokens. To\ntackle this problem, we explore a token reduction mechanism and find, similar\nto prior work, that many visual tokens are spatially redundant. Based on this,\nwe propose PruMerge, a novel adaptive visual token reduction approach, which\nlargely reduces the number of visual tokens while maintaining comparable model\nperformance. We first select the unpruned visual tokens based on their\nsimilarity to class tokens and spatial tokens.

By drawing upon extensive research from both the\nsocial science and AI communities, we propose a set of maxims -- quantity,\nquality, relevance, manner, benevolence, and transparency -- for describing\neffective human-AI conversation. We first justify the applicability of the\nfirst four maxims (from Grice) in the context of human-AI interactions. We then\nargue that two new maxims, benevolence (concerning the generation of, and\nengagement with, harmful content) and transparency (concerning recognition of\none's knowledge boundaries, operational constraints, and intents), are\nnecessary for addressing behavior unique to modern human-AI interactions. The\nproposed maxims offer prescriptive guidance on how to assess conversational\nquality between humans and LLM-driven conversational agents, informing both\ntheir evaluation and improved design.\n","authors":["Erik Miehling","Manish Nagireddy","Prasanna Sattigeri","Elizabeth M.

This misuse of LLM has led to negative\nsocietal consequences. Currently, there are two main approaches to address\njailbreak attacks: safety training and safeguards. Safety training focuses on\nfurther training LLM to enhance its safety. On the other hand, safeguards\ninvolve implementing external models or filters to prevent harmful outputs.\nHowever, safety training has constraints in its ability to adapt to new attack\ntypes and often leads to a drop in model performance.

Recent\nadvances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for translating\nnatural language into robot action sequences for complex tasks. However,\nexisting approaches either translate the natural language directly into robot\ntrajectories or factor the inference process by decomposing language into task\nsub-goals and relying on a motion planner to execute each sub-goal. When\ncomplex environmental and temporal constraints are involved, inference over\nplanning tasks must be performed jointly with motion plans using traditional\ntask-and-motion planning (TAMP) algorithms, making factorization into subgoals\nuntenable. Rather than using LLMs to directly plan task sub-goals, we instead\nperform few-shot translation from natural language task descriptions to an\nintermediate task representation that can then be consumed by a TAMP algorithm\nto jointly solve the task and motion plan.

However, training vision transformers for high-resolution\npixelwise tasks has a prohibitive cost. Typical solutions boil down to\nhierarchical architectures, fast and approximate attention, or training on\nlow-resolution crops. This latter solution does not constrain architectural\nchoices, but it leads to a clear performance drop when testing at resolutions\nsignificantly higher than that used for training, thus requiring ad-hoc and\nslow post-processing schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for\nefficient training and inference of high-resolution vision transformers. The\nkey principle is to mask out most of the high-resolution inputs during\ntraining, keeping only N random windows. This allows the model to learn local\ninteractions between tokens inside each window, and global interactions between\ntokens from different windows. As a result, the model can directly process the\nhigh-resolution input at test time without any special trick. We show that this\nstrategy is effective when using relative positional embedding such as rotary\nembeddings. It is 4 times faster to train than a full-resolution network, and\nit is straightforward to use at test time compared to existing approaches.

In this paper, we explore this attack surface about availability of\nVLMs and aim to induce high energy-latency cost during inference of VLMs. We\nfind that high energy-latency cost during inference of VLMs can be manipulated\nby maximizing the length of generated sequences.

However, its direct adaption in medical image\nsegmentation tasks shows significant performance drops with inferior accuracy\nand unstable results. It may also requires an excessive number of prompt points\nto obtain a reasonable accuracy. For segmenting 3D radiological CT or MRI\nscans, a 2D SAM model has to separately handle hundreds of 2D slices. Although\nquite a few studies explore adapting SAM into medical image volumes, the\nefficiency of 2D adaption methods is unsatisfactory and 3D adaptation methods\nonly capable of segmenting specific organs/tumors. In this work, we propose a\ncomprehensive and scalable 3D SAM model for whole-body CT segmentation, named\nCT-SAM3D. Instead of adapting SAM, we propose a 3D promptable segmentation\nmodel using a (nearly) fully labeled CT dataset. To train CT-SAM3D effectively,\nensuring the model's accurate responses to higher-dimensional spatial prompts\nis crucial, and 3D patch-wise training is required due to GPU memory\nconstraints. For this purpose, we propose two key technical developments: 1) a\nprogressively and spatially aligned prompt encoding method to effectively\nencode click prompts in local 3D space; and 2) a cross-patch prompt learning\nscheme to capture more 3D spatial context, which is beneficial for reducing the\nediting workloads when interactively prompting on large organs.

Thus, using bounding\nboxes (bboxes) as annotations has shown great potential. The current mainstream\napproach is a two-step process, involving the generation of pseudo-labels from\nbox annotations and the training of a 3DIS network with the pseudo-labels.\nHowever, due to the presence of intersections among bboxes, not every point has\na determined instance label, especially in overlapping areas. To generate\nhigher quality pseudo-labels and achieve more precise weakly supervised 3DIS\nresults, we propose the Box-Supervised Simulation-assisted Mean Teacher for 3D\nInstance Segmentation (BSNet), which devises a novel pseudo-labeler called\nSimulation-assisted Transformer.

When it contains only specific types of images, the classifier begins\nto rely on shortcuts - simplistic and erroneous rules for decision-making. This\nleads to high performance on the training dataset but inferior results on new,\nvaried images, as the classifier's generalization capability is reduced. For\nexample, if the images labeled as mustache consist solely of male figures, the\nmodel may inadvertently learn to classify images by gender rather than the\npresence of a mustache. One approach to mitigate such biases is to direct the\nmodel's attention toward the target object's location, usually marked using\nbounding boxes or polygons for annotation. However, collecting such annotations\nrequires substantial time and human effort. Therefore, we propose a novel\npatch-labeling method that integrates AI assistance with crowdsourcing to\ncapture human attention from images, which can be a viable solution for\nmitigating bias. Our method consists of two steps. First, we extract the\napproximate location of a target using a pre-trained saliency detection model\nsupplemented by human verification for accuracy. Then, we determine the\nhuman-attentive area in the image by iteratively dividing the image into\nsmaller patches and employing crowdsourcing to ascertain whether each patch can\nbe classified as the target object. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our\nmethod in mitigating bias through improved classification accuracy and the\nrefined focus of the model. Also, crowdsourced experiments validate that our\nmethod collects human annotation up to 3.4 times faster than annotating object\nlocations with polygons, significantly reducing the need for human resources.\nWe conclude the paper by discussing the advantages of our method in a\ncrowdsourcing context, mainly focusing on aspects of human errors and\naccessibility.\n","authors":["Minsuk Chang","Seokhyeon Park","Hyeon Jeon","Aeri Cho","Soohyun Lee","Jinwook Seo"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15013v1.pdf","comment":"21 pages, 11 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00029v3","updated":"2024-03-22T07:52:28Z","published":"2023-12-29T05:28:35Z","title":"6D-Diff: A Keypoint Diffusion Framework for 6D Object Pose Estimation","summary":"  Estimating the 6D object pose from a single RGB image often involves noise\nand indeterminacy due to challenges such as occlusions and cluttered\nbackgrounds.

This practice is widely\nregarded as secure, even in cases where some annotated errors occur, as the\nimpact of these minor inaccuracies on the final performance of the models is\nnegligible and existing backdoor attacks require attacker's ability to poison\nthe training images. Nevertheless, in this paper, we propose clean-image\nbackdoor attacks which uncover that backdoors can still be injected via a\nfraction of incorrect labels without modifying the training images.\nSpecifically, in our attacks, the attacker first seeks a trigger feature to\ndivide the training images into two parts: those with the feature and those\nwithout it. Subsequently, the attacker falsifies the labels of the former part\nto a backdoor class. The backdoor will be finally implanted into the target\nmodel after it is trained on the poisoned data. During the inference phase, the\nattacker can activate the backdoor in two ways: slightly modifying the input\nimage to obtain the trigger feature, or taking an image that naturally has the\ntrigger feature as input. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the\neffectiveness and practicality of our attacks.

The first-generation autonomous driving datasets are\ncharacterized by relatively simpler sensor modalities, smaller data scale, and\nis limited to perception-level tasks. KITTI, introduced in 2012, serves as a\nprominent representative of this initial wave. In contrast, the\nsecond-generation datasets exhibit heightened complexity in sensor modalities,\ngreater data scale and diversity, and an expansion of tasks from perception to\nencompass prediction and control. Leading examples of the second generation\ninclude nuScenes and Waymo, introduced around 2019. This comprehensive review,\nconducted in collaboration with esteemed colleagues from both academia and\nindustry, systematically assesses over seventy open-source autonomous driving\ndatasets from domestic and international sources. It offers insights into\nvarious aspects, such as the principles underlying the creation of high-quality\ndatasets, the pivotal role of data engine systems, and the utilization of\ngenerative foundation models to facilitate scalable data generation.\nFurthermore, this review undertakes an exhaustive analysis and discourse\nregarding the characteristics and data scales that future third-generation\nautonomous driving datasets should possess.

While a considerable amount of research has been\ndedicated to remote sensing classification, object detection and semantic\nsegmentation, most of these studies have overlooked the valuable prior\nknowledge embedded within remote sensing scenarios. Such prior knowledge can be\nuseful because remote sensing objects may be mistakenly recognized without\nreferencing a sufficiently long-range context, which can vary for different\nobjects. This paper considers these priors and proposes a lightweight Large\nSelective Kernel Network (LSKNet) backbone. LSKNet can dynamically adjust its\nlarge spatial receptive field to better model the ranging context of various\nobjects in remote sensing scenarios. To our knowledge, large and selective\nkernel mechanisms have not been previously explored in remote sensing images.\nWithout bells and whistles, our lightweight LSKNet sets new state-of-the-art\nscores on standard remote sensing classification, object detection and semantic\nsegmentation benchmarks.

Social media is a natural\nplatform for users to employ bragging in order to gain admiration, respect,\nattention and followers from their audiences.

This paper employs\ncomputational sociolinguistics methods to conduct the first large scale study\nof bragging behavior on Twitter (U.S.) by focusing on its overall prevalence,\ntemporal dynamics and impact of demographic factors. Our study shows that the\nprevalence of bragging decreases over time within the same population of users.\nIn addition, younger, more educated and popular users in the U.S. are more\nlikely to brag.

Many sought to mitigate this by restricting the\nattention window within the pre-trained length. However, these methods\nintroduce new issues such as ignoring the middle context and requiring\nadditional training. To address these problems, we propose LongHeads, a\ntraining-free framework that enhances LLM's long context ability by unlocking\nmulti-head attention's untapped potential. Instead of allowing each head to\nattend to the full sentence, which struggles with generalizing to longer\nsequences due to out-of-distribution (OOD) issues, we allow each head to\nprocess in-distribution length by selecting and attending to important context\nchunks. To this end, we propose a chunk selection strategy that relies on the\ninherent correlation between the query and the key representations, efficiently\ndistributing context chunks to different heads. In this way, each head ensures\nit can effectively process attended tokens within the trained length, while\ndifferent heads in different layers can collectively process longer contexts.\nLongHeads works efficiently in linear time, fits seamlessly with many LLMs that\nuse relative positional encoding. LongHeads achieves 100% accuracy at the 128k\nlength on passkey retrieval task, verifying LongHeads's efficacy in extending\nthe usable context window for existing models.

However, these approaches\ndemand substantial hardware resources during the training and/or inference\nphases. Our proposed method, Temp-Lora, introduces an alternative concept.\nInstead of relying on the KV cache to store all context information, we embeds\nthis information directly into a temporary Lora module. In the process of long\ntext generation, this module is progressively trained with text generated\npreviously. This approach not only efficiently preserves contextual knowledge\nbut also prevents any permanent alteration to the model's parameters given that\nthe module is discarded post-generation. Extensive experiments on the PG19\nlanguage modeling benchmark and the GuoFeng discourse-level translation\nbenchmark validate the effectiveness of Temp-Lora. Our results show that: 1)\nTemp-Lora substantially enhances generation quality for long text, as indicated\nby a 13.2% decrease in perplexity (PPL) on a subset of PG19, and a 29.3%\ndecrease in PPL along with a 113.2% increase in BLEU score on a subset of\nGuoFeng, 2) Temp-Lora is compatible with and enhances most existing long text\ngeneration methods, and 3) Temp-Lora can greatly reduce computational costs by\nshortening the context window. For example, we can ensure a moderate\nimprovement in generation quality (a decrease of 3.8% in PPL) while enabling a\n51.5% memory usage reduction and a 60.0% decrease in latency for inference.\n","authors":["Y.

The rise of foundation models trained on\nmultiple tasks with impressively large datasets from a variety of fields has\nled researchers to believe that these models may provide common sense reasoning\nthat existing planners are missing. Researchers posit that this common sense\nreasoning will bridge the gap between algorithm development and deployment to\nout-of-distribution tasks, like how humans adapt to unexpected scenarios. Large\nlanguage models have already penetrated the robotics and autonomous systems\ndomains as researchers are scrambling to showcase their potential use cases in\ndeployment. While this application direction is very promising empirically,\nfoundation models are known to hallucinate and generate decisions that may\nsound reasonable, but are in fact poor. We argue there is a need to step back\nand simultaneously design systems that can quantify the certainty of a model's\ndecision, and detect when it may be hallucinating. In this work, we discuss the\ncurrent use cases of foundation models for decision-making tasks, provide a\ngeneral definition for hallucinations with examples, discuss existing\napproaches to hallucination detection and mitigation with a focus on decision\nproblems, and explore areas for further research in this exciting field.\n","authors":["Neeloy Chakraborty","Melkior Ornik","Katherine Driggs-Campbell"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16527v1.pdf","comment":"31 pages, 2 tables"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16516v1","updated":"2024-03-25T08:00:43Z","published":"2024-03-25T08:00:43Z","title":"Visually Guided Generative Text-Layout Pre-training for Document\n  Intelligence","summary":"  Prior study shows that pre-training techniques can boost the performance of\nvisual document understanding (VDU), which typically requires models to gain\nabilities to perceive and reason both document texts and layouts (e.g.,\nlocations of texts and table-cells).

To overcome this challenge, we propose an\nautomatic evaluation paradigm tailored to assess the LLMs' capabilities in\ndelivering clinical services, e.g., disease diagnosis and treatment. The\nevaluation paradigm contains three basic elements: metric, data, and algorithm.\nSpecifically, inspired by professional clinical practice pathways, we formulate\na LLM-specific clinical pathway (LCP) to define the clinical capabilities that\na doctor agent should possess. Then, Standardized Patients (SPs) from the\nmedical education are introduced as the guideline for collecting medical data\nfor evaluation, which can well ensure the completeness of the evaluation\nprocedure.

The above paradigm can\nbe extended to any similar clinical scenarios to automatically evaluate the\nLLMs' medical capabilities.

Furthermore, previous sparse and\nlinear approaches lose interpretability if they cannot produce full attention\nmatrices. To address these challenges, we propose SEA: Sparse linear attention\nwith an Estimated Attention mask. SEA estimates the attention matrix with\nlinear complexity via kernel-based linear attention, then subsequently creates\na sparse attention matrix with a top-k selection to perform a sparse attention\noperation. For language modeling tasks (Wikitext2), previous linear and sparse\nattention methods show roughly two-fold worse perplexity scores over the\nquadratic OPT-1.3B baseline, while SEA achieves better perplexity than\nOPT-1.3B, using roughly half the memory of OPT-1.3B, providing interpretable\nattention matrix.

Controlling for factors such as restaurant price and\nneighborhood racial diversity, we find that immigrant cuisines are more likely\nto be othered using socially constructed frames of authenticity (e.g.,\n\"authentic,\" \"traditional\"), and that non-European cuisines (e.g., Indian,\nMexican) in particular are described as more exotic compared to European ones\n(e.g., French). We also find that non-European cuisines are more likely to be\ndescribed as cheap and dirty, even after controlling for price, and even among\nthe most expensive restaurants. Finally, we show that reviews generated by LLMs\nreproduce similar framing tendencies, pointing to the downstream retention of\nthese representational harms. Our results corroborate social theories of\ngastronomic stereotyping, revealing racialized evaluative processes and\nlinguistic strategies through which they manifest.\n","authors":["Yiwei Luo","Kristina Gligorić","Dan Jurafsky"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.07645v2.pdf","comment":"ICWSM '24"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12151v2","updated":"2024-03-25T18:50:06Z","published":"2024-03-18T18:08:44Z","title":"Fusing Domain-Specific Content from Large Language Models into Knowledge\n  Graphs for Enhanced Zero Shot Object State Classification","summary":"  Domain-specific knowledge can significantly contribute to addressing a wide\nvariety of vision tasks.

The relevance between the pretraining pretext and target\ntasks is crucial to the success of transfer learning. Various pretext tasks\nhave been proposed to utilize properties of medical image data (e.g., three\ndimensionality), which are more relevant to medical image analysis than generic\nones for natural images. However, previous work rarely paid attention to data\nwith anatomy-oriented imaging planes, e.g., standard cardiac magnetic resonance\nimaging views. As these imaging planes are defined according to the anatomy of\nthe imaged organ, pretext tasks effectively exploiting this information can\npretrain the networks to gain knowledge on the organ of interest. In this work,\nwe propose two complementary pretext tasks for this group of medical image data\nbased on the spatial relationship of the imaging planes. The first is to learn\nthe relative orientation between the imaging planes and implemented as\nregressing their intersecting lines. The second exploits parallel imaging\nplanes to regress their relative slice locations within a stack. Both pretext\ntasks are conceptually straightforward and easy to implement, and can be\ncombined in multitask learning for better representation learning. Thorough\nexperiments on two anatomical structures (heart and knee) and representative\ntarget tasks (semantic segmentation and classification) demonstrate that the\nproposed pretext tasks are effective in pretraining deep networks for\nremarkably boosted performance on the target tasks, and superior to other\nrecent approaches.\n","authors":["Tianwei Zhang","Dong Wei","Mengmeng Zhua","Shi Gu","Yefeng Zheng"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16499v1.pdf","comment":"Medical Image Analysis"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16497v1","updated":"2024-03-25T07:29:18Z","published":"2024-03-25T07:29:18Z","title":"PathoTune: Adapting Visual Foundation Model to Pathological Specialists","summary":"  As natural image understanding moves towards the pretrain-finetune era,\nresearch in pathology imaging is concurrently evolving.

In\nthis paper, we present PIA, a Personalized Image Animator that excels in\naligning with condition images, achieving motion controllability by text, and\nthe compatibility with various personalized T2I models without specific tuning.\nTo achieve these goals, PIA builds upon a base T2I model with well-trained\ntemporal alignment layers, allowing for the seamless transformation of any\npersonalized T2I model into an image animation model. A key component of PIA is\nthe introduction of the condition module, which utilizes the condition frame\nand inter-frame affinity as input to transfer appearance information guided by\nthe affinity hint for individual frame synthesis in the latent space.

This paper\nintroduces feedback control algorithms that automatically tune the bias\nparameters through two interacting methods: 1) An immediate, on-the-fly fast\nadaptation of the refractory period, which sets the minimum interval between\nconsecutive events, and 2) if the event rate exceeds the specified bounds even\nafter changing the refractory period repeatedly, the controller adapts the\npixel bandwidth and event thresholds, which stabilizes after a short period of\nnoise events across all pixels (slow adaptation).

In this paper, we conduct a\ncomprehensive analysis of hard pixel errors, categorizing them into three\ntypes: false responses, merging mistakes, and displacements. Our findings\nreveal a quantitative association between hard pixels and aliasing, which is\ndistortion caused by the overlapping of frequency components in the Fourier\ndomain during downsampling. To identify the frequencies responsible for\naliasing, we propose using the equivalent sampling rate to calculate the\nNyquist frequency, which marks the threshold for aliasing. Then, we introduce\nthe aliasing score as a metric to quantify the extent of aliasing. While\npositively correlated with the proposed aliasing score, three types of hard\npixels exhibit different patterns. Here, we propose two novel de-aliasing\nfilter (DAF) and frequency mixing (FreqMix) modules to alleviate aliasing\ndegradation by accurately removing or adjusting frequencies higher than the\nNyquist frequency. The DAF precisely removes the frequencies responsible for\naliasing before downsampling, while the FreqMix dynamically selects\nhigh-frequency components within the encoder block.

It\nrequires grasping global information from both parts and the entire image for\nbetter segmenting, and clinically there are often certain requirements for\nsegmentation efficiency. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made\nconsiderable achievements in MIS. However, they are difficult to fully collect\nglobal context information and their pooling layer may cause information loss.\nCapsule networks, which combine the benefits of CNNs while taking into account\nadditional information such as relative location that CNNs do not, have lately\ndemonstrated some advantages in MIS. Vision Transformer (ViT) employs\ntransformers in visual tasks. Transformer based on attention mechanism has\nexcellent global inductive modeling capabilities and is expected to capture\nlongrange information. Moreover, there have been resent studies on making ViT\nmore lightweight to minimize model complexity and increase efficiency. In this\npaper, we propose a U-shaped 3D encoder-decoder network named 3D-EffiViTCaps,\nwhich combines 3D capsule blocks with 3D EfficientViT blocks for MIS. Our\nencoder uses capsule blocks and EfficientViT blocks to jointly capture local\nand global semantic information more effectively and efficiently with less\ninformation loss, while the decoder employs CNN blocks and EfficientViT blocks\nto catch ffner details for segmentation.

However, collecting and\nannotating data on a large scale is often both costly and time-intensive,\nparticularly in medical cases where practitioners are already occupied with\ntheir duties. Moreover, ensuring that the model remains robust across various\nscenarios of image capture is crucial in medical domains, especially when\ndealing with ultrasound images that vary based on the settings of different\ndevices and the manual operation of the transducer. To address this challenge,\nwe introduce a novel pipeline called MEDDAP, which leverages Stable Diffusion\n(SD) models to augment existing small datasets by automatically generating new\ninformative labeled samples. Pretrained checkpoints for SD are typically based\non natural images, and training them for medical images requires significant\nGPU resources due to their heavy parameters. To overcome this challenge, we\nintroduce USLoRA (Ultrasound Low-Rank Adaptation), a novel fine-tuning method\ntailored specifically for ultrasound applications. USLoRA allows for selective\nfine-tuning of weights within SD, requiring fewer than 0.1\\% of parameters\ncompared to fully fine-tuning only the UNet portion of SD. To enhance dataset\ndiversity, we incorporate different adjectives into the generation process\nprompts, thereby desensitizing the classifiers to intensity changes across\ndifferent images. This approach is inspired by clinicians' decision-making\nprocesses regarding breast tumors, where tumor shape often plays a more crucial\nrole than intensity.

Position\nEmbedding (PE) scaling methods, while effective in extending the context window\nto a specific length, demonstrate either notable limitations in their\nextrapolation abilities or sacrificing partial performance within the context\nwindow. Length extrapolation methods, although theoretically capable of\nextending the context window beyond the training sequence length, often\nunderperform in practical long-context applications.

Thus, it is necessary to account for possible\ntemporal shifts when analysing these stances. This study aims to examine the\nimpact of temporal concept drift on stance detection towards COVID-19\nvaccination on Twitter. To this end, we evaluate a range of transformer-based\nmodels using chronological (splitting the training, validation, and test sets\nin order of time) and random splits (randomly splitting these three sets) of\nsocial media data. Our findings reveal significant discrepancies in model\nperformance between random and chronological splits in several existing\nCOVID-19-related datasets; specifically, chronological splits significantly\nreduce the accuracy of stance classification. Therefore, real-world stance\ndetection approaches need to be further refined to incorporate temporal factors\nas a key consideration.\n","authors":["Yida Mu","Mali Jin","Kalina Bontcheva","Xingyi Song"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.04806v3.pdf","comment":"Accepted at LREC-COLING 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16204v1","updated":"2024-03-24T15:57:24Z","published":"2024-03-24T15:57:24Z","title":"SQL-Encoder: Improving NL2SQL In-Context Learning Through a\n  Context-Aware Encoder","summary":"  Detecting structural similarity between queries is essential for selecting\nexamples in in-context learning models.

Despite the leakage rate being\nthe origin of data leakage issues, it is not understood how it affects the\noutput rate and detection rate. In this paper, we conduct an experimental\nsurvey to elucidate the relationship between the leakage rate and both the\noutput rate and detection rate for personal information, copyrighted texts, and\nbenchmark data.

However, finding the prompt\nwith the lowest perplexity is challenging, given the enormous space of possible\nprompting phrases. In this paper, we propose monotonic paraphrasing (MonoPara),\nan end-to-end decoding strategy that paraphrases given prompts or instructions\ninto their lower perplexity counterparts based on an ensemble of a paraphrase\nLM for prompt (or instruction) rewriting, and a target LM (i.e. the prompt or\ninstruction executor) that constrains the generation for lower perplexity. The\nensemble decoding process can efficiently paraphrase the original prompt\nwithout altering its semantic meaning, while monotonically decreasing the\nperplexity of each generation as calculated by the target LM. We explore in\ndetail both greedy and search-based decoding as two alternative decoding\nschemes of MonoPara. Notably, MonoPara does not require any training and can\nmonotonically lower the perplexity of the paraphrased prompt or instruction,\nleading to improved performance of zero-shot LM prompting as evaluated on a\nwide selection of tasks.

Therefore, we propose a novel prior semantic guided image fusion\nmethod based on the dual-modality strategy, improving the performance of IVF in\nITS.

Then, two pilot experiments based on the two branches are conducted to\ncapture the significant prior semantic of two images, which then is applied to\nguide the fusion task in the integration of semantic segmentation branches and\nfusion branches. In addition, to aggregate both high-level semantics and\nimpressive visual effects, we further investigate the frequency response of the\nprior semantics, and propose a multi-level representation-adaptive fusion\n(MRaF) module to explicitly integrate the low-frequent prior semantic with the\nhigh-frequent details.

Various\nself-verification methods have been proposed in pursuit of this goal.\nNevertheless, whether existing models understand their own errors well is still\nunder investigation. In this paper, we take a closer look at the\nself-verification abilities of LLMs in the context of logical reasoning,\nfocusing on their ability to identify logical fallacies accurately. We\nintroduce a dataset, FALLACIES, containing 232 types of reasoning fallacies\ncategorized in a hierarchical taxonomy. By conducting exhaustive experiments on\nFALLACIES, we obtain comprehensive and detailed analyses of a series of models\non their verification abilities. Our main findings suggest that existing LLMs\ncould struggle to identify fallacious reasoning steps accurately and may fall\nshort of guaranteeing the validity of self-verification methods. Drawing from\nthese observations, we offer suggestions for future research and practical\napplications of self-verification methods.\n","authors":["Ruixin Hong","Hongming Zhang","Xinyu Pang","Dong Yu","Changshui Zhang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.07954v2.pdf","comment":"NAACL 2024 Main Conference"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11093v3","updated":"2024-03-23T13:33:06Z","published":"2023-09-20T06:54:55Z","title":"K-pop Lyric Translation: Dataset, Analysis, and Neural-Modelling","summary":"  Lyric translation, a field studied for over a century, is now attracting\ncomputational linguistics researchers.

We further quantify the gap\nbetween MCQs and long-form generation questions (LFGQs) by comparing their\ndirect outputs, token logits, and embeddings.

An advantage of these models\nover more standard approaches based on fine-tuning is the ability to understand\ninstructions written in natural language (prompts), which helps them generalise\nbetter to different tasks and domains without the need for specific training\ndata. This makes them suitable for addressing text classification problems for\ndomains with limited amounts of annotated instances. However, existing research\nis limited in scale and lacks understanding of how text generation models\ncombined with prompting techniques compare to more established methods for text\nclassification such as fine-tuning masked language models. In this paper, we\naddress this research gap by performing a large-scale evaluation study for 16\ntext classification datasets covering binary, multiclass, and multilabel\nproblems. In particular, we compare zero- and few-shot approaches of large\nlanguage models to fine-tuning smaller language models.

Many MOEAs have been proposed in\nthe past decades, of which the search operators need a carefully handcrafted\ndesign with domain knowledge. Recently, some attempts have been made to replace\nthe manually designed operators in MOEAs with learning-based operators (e.g.,\nneural network models). However, much effort is still required for designing\nand training such models, and the learned operators might not generalize well\non new problems. To tackle the above challenges, this work investigates a novel\napproach that leverages the powerful large language model (LLM) to design MOEA\noperators. With proper prompt engineering, we successfully let a general LLM\nserve as a black-box search operator for decomposition-based MOEA (MOEA/D) in a\nzero-shot manner. In addition, by learning from the LLM behavior, we further\ndesign an explicit white-box operator with randomness and propose a new version\nof decomposition-based MOEA, termed MOEA/D-LO. Experimental studies on\ndifferent test benchmarks show that our proposed method can achieve competitive\nperformance with widely used MOEAs.

This challenge is even more for regional\nBengali dialects due to unavailability of standardized spelling conventions for\nthese dialects, presence of local and foreign words popular in those regions\nand phonological diversity across different regions. This paper presents an\napproach to this sequence-to-sequence problem by introducing the District\nGuided Tokens (DGT) technique on a new dataset spanning six districts of\nBangladesh. The key idea is to provide the model with explicit information\nabout the regional dialect or \"district\" of the input text before generating\nthe IPA transcription. This is achieved by prepending a district token to the\ninput sequence, effectively guiding the model to understand the unique phonetic\npatterns associated with each district.

Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of DGT, with the ByT5 model achieving\nsuperior performance over word-based models like mT5, BanglaT5, and umT5.

Prompt bias presents a significant challenge in\nassessing the factual knowledge within PLMs. Therefore, this paper aims to\nimprove the reliability of existing benchmarks by thoroughly investigating and\nmitigating prompt bias. We show that: 1) all prompts in the experiments exhibit\nnon-negligible bias, with gradient-based prompts like AutoPrompt and OptiPrompt\ndisplaying significantly higher levels of bias; 2) prompt bias can amplify\nbenchmark accuracy unreasonably by overfitting the test datasets, especially on\nimbalanced datasets like LAMA. Based on these findings, we propose a\nrepresentation-based approach to mitigate the prompt bias during inference\ntime. Specifically, we first estimate the biased representation using\nprompt-only querying, and then remove it from the model's internal\nrepresentations to generate the debiased representations, which are used to\nproduce the final debiased outputs.

We further conduct paired comparison experiments under\ndifferent ranges of subjectivity scores, where the baseline comes from 8,346\nhuman annotations.

In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel methodology named eXplainable Lexicons (XLex) that combines the\nadvantages of both lexicon-based methods and transformer models.

Each intersection is equipped with 6-18 sensors to\ncapture synchronous data. While autonomous vehicles pass through these\nintersections for collecting VIC data. HoloVIC contains in total on 100k+\nsynchronous frames from different sensors. Additionally, we annotated 3D\nbounding boxes based on Camera, Fisheye, and Lidar. We also associate the IDs\nof the same objects across different devices and consecutive frames in\nsequence. Based on HoloVIC, we formulated four tasks to facilitate the\ndevelopment of related research.

From calculating biomarkers such as ejection\nfraction to the probability of a patient's heart failure, accurate segmentation\nof the heart structures allows doctors to assess the heart's condition and\ndevise treatments with greater precision and accuracy. However, achieving\naccurate and reliable left ventricle segmentation is time-consuming and\nchallenging due to different reasons. Hence, clinicians often rely on\nsegmenting the left ventricular (LV) in two specific echocardiogram frames to\nmake a diagnosis. This limited coverage in manual LV segmentation poses a\nchallenge for developing automatic LV segmentation with high temporal\nconsistency, as the resulting dataset is typically annotated sparsely. In\nresponse to this challenge, this work introduces SimLVSeg, a novel paradigm\nthat enables video-based networks for consistent LV segmentation from sparsely\nannotated echocardiogram videos. SimLVSeg consists of self-supervised\npre-training with temporal masking, followed by weakly supervised learning\ntailored for LV segmentation from sparse annotations. We demonstrate how\nSimLVSeg outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions by achieving a 93.32%\n(95%CI 93.21-93.43%) dice score on the largest 2D+time echocardiography dataset\n(EchoNet-Dynamic) while being more efficient.

Specifically, to help the\nmodel extract cloth-irrelevant clues, we propose a Clothes Diversity\nAugmentation (CDA), which generates more realistic cloth-changing samples by\nenriching the clothing color while preserving the texture. In addition, a\nMulti-scale Constraint Block (MCB) is designed, which extracts fine-grained\nidentity-related features and effectively transfers cloth-irrelevant knowledge.\nMoreover, a Counterfactual-guided Attention Module (CAM) is presented, which\nlearns cloth-irrelevant features from channel and space dimensions and utilizes\nthe counterfactual intervention for supervising the attention map to highlight\nidentity-related regions. Finally, a Semantic Alignment Constraint (SAC) is\ndesigned to facilitate high-level semantic feature interaction.

However, we identify two key\nlimitations in a conventional label assignment for training Transformer-based\nVRD models, which is a process of mapping a ground-truth (GT) to a prediction.\nUnder the conventional assignment, an unspecialized query is trained since a\nquery is expected to detect every relation, which makes it difficult for a\nquery to specialize in specific relations. Furthermore, a query is also\ninsufficiently trained since a GT is assigned only to a single prediction,\ntherefore near-correct or even correct predictions are suppressed by being\nassigned no relation as a GT. To address these issues, we propose Groupwise\nQuery Specialization and Quality-Aware Multi-Assignment (SpeaQ). Groupwise\nQuery Specialization trains a specialized query by dividing queries and\nrelations into disjoint groups and directing a query in a specific query group\nsolely toward relations in the corresponding relation group.

Then, the\nmodality-specific features undergo purification to reduce their modality style\ndiscrepancies while preserving identity-aware discriminative knowledge.\nSubsequently, this kind of implicit knowledge is distilled into the\nmodality-shared feature to enhance its distinctiveness. Finally, an alignment\nloss is proposed to minimize modality discrepancy on enhanced modality-shared\nfeatures. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of IDKL network over the state-of-the-art methods.

The\nDS-AL contains a main stream offering an analytical (i.e., closed-form) linear\nsolution, and a compensation stream improving the inherent under-fitting\nlimitation due to adopting linear mapping. The main stream redefines the CIL\nproblem into a Concatenated Recursive Least Squares (C-RLS) task, allowing an\nequivalence between the CIL and its joint-learning counterpart. The\ncompensation stream is governed by a Dual-Activation Compensation (DAC) module.\nThis module re-activates the embedding with a different activation function\nfrom the main stream one, and seeks fitting compensation by projecting the\nembedding to the null space of the main stream's linear mapping.

Our method enables the manipulation of\nhuman-understandable, semantic face features, such as nose length or mouth\nwidth, which are defined by different groups of facial landmarks. In contrast\nto existing methods, the use of facial landmarks enables precise measurement of\nthe facial features, which then enables training SeFFeC without any manually\nannotated labels. SeFFeC consists of a transformer-based encoder network that\ntakes a latent vector of a pre-trained generative model and a facial feature\nembedding as input, and learns to modify the latent vector to perform the\ndesired face edit operation. To ensure that the desired feature measurement is\nchanged towards the target value without altering uncorrelated features, we\nintroduced a novel semantic face feature loss.

In this work, we propose\nfeature extraction with clustering (FEC), a conceptually elegant yet\nsurprisingly ad-hoc interpretable neural clustering framework, which views\nfeature extraction as a process of selecting representatives from data and thus\nautomatically captures the underlying data distribution. Given an image, FEC\nalternates between grouping pixels into individual clusters to abstract\nrepresentatives and updating the deep features of pixels with current\nrepresentatives. Such an iterative working mechanism is implemented in the form\nof several neural layers and the final representatives can be used for\ndownstream tasks. The cluster assignments across layers, which can be viewed\nand inspected by humans, make the forward process of FEC fully transparent and\nempower it with promising ad-hoc interpretability.

It can be achieved either by imposing\nconstraints on AI actors such as developers, deployers and users, and on AI\nresources such as data, or by imposing constraints on the range and scope of\nthe impact that AI agents can have on the environment. The latter approach\ninvolves encoding extant rules concerning AI driven devices into the software\nof AI agents controlling those devices (e.g., encoding rules about limitations\non zones of operations into the agent software of an autonomous drone device).\nThis is a challenge since the effectivity of such an approach requires a method\nof extracting, loading, transforming and computing legal information that would\nbe both explainable and legally interoperable, and that would enable AI agents\nto reason about the law.

Most of the existing works focus on improving\nthe representation ability for the contextualized embedding of the [CLS] token\nand calculate relevance using textual semantic similarity. However, in the\nlegal domain, textual semantic similarity does not always imply that the cases\nare relevant enough. Instead, relevance in legal cases primarily depends on the\nsimilarity of key facts that impact the final judgment. Without proper\ntreatments, the discriminative ability of learned representations could be\nlimited since legal cases are lengthy and contain numerous non-key facts. To\nthis end, we introduce DELTA, a discriminative model designed for legal case\nretrieval. The basic idea involves pinpointing key facts in legal cases and\npulling the contextualized embedding of the [CLS] token closer to the key facts\nwhile pushing away from the non-key facts, which can warm up the case embedding\nspace in an unsupervised manner. To be specific, this study brings the word\nalignment mechanism to the contextual masked auto-encoder.

In this study, we introduce\na simple yet novel strategy where only a single Vision Language Model (VLM) is\nutilized.

Transformer architecture's core\nmechanism -- attention requires $O(n^2)$ time complexity in training and $O(n)$\ntime complexity in inference. Many works have been proposed to improve the\nattention mechanism's scalability, such as Flash Attention and Multi-query\nAttention. A different line of work aims to design new mechanisms to replace\nattention. Recently, a notable model structure -- Mamba, which is based on\nstate space models, has achieved transformer-equivalent performance in multiple\nsequence modeling tasks.\n  In this work, we examine \\mamba's efficacy through the lens of a classical IR\ntask -- document ranking. A reranker model takes a query and a document as\ninput, and predicts a scalar relevance score. This task demands the language\nmodel's ability to comprehend lengthy contextual inputs and to capture the\ninteraction between query and document tokens. We find that (1) Mamba models\nachieve competitive performance compared to transformer-based models with the\nsame training recipe; (2) but also have a lower training throughput in\ncomparison to efficient transformer implementations such as flash attention.

It leads to the cross-contamination problem, where the\nmodel confuses different initiatives and generates inappropriate responses.\nMoreover, obtaining plenty of human annotations for initiative labels can be\nexpensive. To address this issue, we propose a general mix-Initiative Dynamic\nPrefix Tuning framework (IDPT) to decouple different initiatives from the\ngeneration model, which learns initiative-aware prefixes in both supervised and\nunsupervised settings. Specifically, IDPT decouples initiative factors into\ndifferent prefix parameters and uses the attention mechanism to adjust the\nselection of initiatives in guiding generation dynamically. The prefix\nparameters can be tuned towards accurate initiative prediction as well as\nmix-initiative response generation. Extensive experiments on two public\ndialogue datasets show that the proposed IDPT outperforms previous baselines on\nboth automatic metrics and human evaluations.

Leveraging\nthe foundational model MPNet, DP-means clustering, and Hawkes processes, we\ntrace how narratives spread between news sites and Telegram channels. We show\nthat news outlets not only propagate existing narratives through Telegram but\nthat they source material from the messaging platform. For example, across the\nwebsites in our study, between 2.3% (ura.news) and 26.7% (ukraina.ru) of\narticles discussed content that originated/resulted from activity on Telegram.\nFinally, tracking the spread of individual topics, we measure the rate at which\nnews outlets and Telegram channels disseminate content within the Russian media\necosystem, finding that websites like ura.news and Telegram channels such as\n@genshab are the most effective at disseminating their content.\n","authors":["Hans W.

The main\nchallenges are the lack of observations and the inherent ambiguities of the\nsetting, e.g. occlusions and depth ambiguity. As a result, radiance fields,\nwhich have shown great promise in capturing high-frequency appearance and\ngeometry details in dense setups, perform poorly when na\\\"ively supervising\nthem on sparse camera views, as the field simply overfits to the sparse-view\ninputs. To address this, we propose MetaCap, a method for efficient and\nhigh-quality geometry recovery and novel view synthesis given very sparse or\neven a single view of the human. Our key idea is to meta-learn the radiance\nfield weights solely from potentially sparse multi-view videos, which can serve\nas a prior when fine-tuning them on sparse imagery depicting the human. This\nprior provides a good network weight initialization, thereby effectively\naddressing ambiguities in sparse-view capture. Due to the articulated structure\nof the human body and motion-induced surface deformations, learning such a\nprior is non-trivial. Therefore, we propose to meta-learn the field weights in\na pose-canonicalized space, which reduces the spatial feature range and makes\nfeature learning more effective. Consequently, one can fine-tune our field\nparameters to quickly generalize to unseen poses, novel illumination conditions\nas well as novel and sparse (even monocular) camera views.

Current cross-modal methods transform images into 3D\npoints using depth estimation for modality conversion, which are usually\ncomputationally intensive and need expensive labeled data for depth\nsupervision.

To develop a deep-learning based system for recognition of subclinical\natherosclerosis on a plain frontal chest x-ray. Methods and Results. A\ndeep-learning algorithm to predict coronary artery calcium (CAC) score (the\nAI-CAC model) was developed on 460 chest x-ray (80% training cohort, 20%\ninternal validation cohort) of primary prevention patients (58.4% male, median\nage 63 [51-74] years) with available paired chest x-ray and chest computed\ntomography (CT) indicated for any clinical reason and performed within 3\nmonths. The CAC score calculated on chest CT was used as ground truth. The\nmodel was validated on an temporally-independent cohort of 90 patients from the\nsame institution (external validation). The diagnostic accuracy of the AI-CAC\nmodel assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) was the primary outcome.\nOverall, median AI-CAC score was 35 (0-388) and 28.9% patients had no AI-CAC.\nAUC of the AI-CAC model to identify a CAC>0 was 0.90 in the internal validation\ncohort and 0.77 in the external validation cohort. Sensitivity was consistently\nabove 92% in both cohorts. In the overall cohort (n=540), among patients with\nAI-CAC=0, a single ASCVD event occurred, after 4.3 years. Patients with\nAI-CAC>0 had significantly higher Kaplan Meier estimates for ASCVD events\n(13.5% vs. 3.4%, log-rank=0.013). Conclusion. The AI-CAC model seems to\naccurately detect subclinical atherosclerosis on chest x-ray with elevated\nsensitivity, and to predict ASCVD events with elevated negative predictive\nvalue.

One key factor of the\ngreat comprehension power of the large language model is that natural language\ntokenizers utilize meaningful words or subwords as the basic elements of\nlanguage. In contrast, mainstream visual tokenizers, represented by patch-based\nmethods such as Patch Embed, rely on meaningless rectangular patches as basic\nelements of vision, which cannot serve as effectively as words or subwords in\nlanguage. Starting from the essence of the tokenizer, we defined semantically\nindependent regions (SIRs) for vision. We designed a simple HOmogeneous visual\ntOKenizer: HOOK. HOOK mainly consists of two modules: the Object Perception\nModule (OPM) and the Object Vectorization Module (OVM). To achieve homogeneity,\nthe OPM splits the image into 4*4 pixel seeds and then utilizes the attention\nmechanism to perceive SIRs. The OVM employs cross-attention to merge seeds\nwithin the same SIR.

Unfortunately, the energy consumption\nand decision latency are not robust against adversaries. Researchers have\nrecently demonstrated that attackers can compute and submit so-called sponge\nexamples at inference time to increase the energy consumption and decision\nlatency of neural networks. In computer vision, the proposed strategy crafts\ninputs with less activation sparsity which could otherwise be used to\naccelerate the computation. In this paper, we analyze the mechanism how these\nenergy-latency attacks reduce activation sparsity. In particular, we find that\ninput uniformity is a key enabler.

The essence\nof video comprehension lies in adeptly managing the temporal aspects along with\nthe spatial details of each frame. Initially, we transform a video into a\nsingle composite image by arranging multiple frames in a grid layout. The\nresulting single image is termed as an image grid.

Despite their\nadvancements, our investigation reveals a noteworthy bias in the generated\ncontent, where the output is primarily influenced by the underlying Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) prior rather than the input image. Our empirical\nexperiments underscore the persistence of this bias, as LVLMs often provide\nconfident answers even in the absence of relevant images or given incongruent\nvisual input. To rectify these biases and redirect the model's focus toward\nvision information, we introduce two simple, training-free strategies. Firstly,\nfor tasks such as classification or multi-choice question-answering (QA), we\npropose a ``calibration'' step through affine transformation to adjust the\noutput distribution. This ``Post-Hoc debias'' approach ensures uniform scores\nfor each answer when the image is absent, serving as an effective\nregularization technique to alleviate the influence of LLM priors. For more\nintricate open-ended generation tasks, we extend this method to ``Debias\nsampling'', drawing inspirations from contrastive decoding methods.\nFurthermore, our investigation sheds light on the instability of LVLMs across\nvarious decoding configurations.

A key enabler for generating high-resolution images with low\ncomputational cost has been the development of latent diffusion models (LDMs).\nIn contrast to conventional diffusion models, LDMs perform the denoising\nprocess in the low-dimensional latent space of a pre-trained autoencoder (AE)\ninstead of the high-dimensional image space. Despite their relevance, the\nforensic analysis of LDMs is still in its infancy. In this work we propose\nAEROBLADE, a novel detection method which exploits an inherent component of\nLDMs: the AE used to transform images between image and latent space. We find\nthat generated images can be more accurately reconstructed by the AE than real\nimages, allowing for a simple detection approach based on the reconstruction\nerror. Most importantly, our method is easy to implement and does not require\nany training, yet nearly matches the performance of detectors that rely on\nextensive training.

In this\npaper, we observe that queries that are the most similar to images in the\ndatabase result in a higher proportion of feature matches and, thus, more\naccurate positioning. Thus, a small number of images is sufficient for queries\nvery similar to images in the reference database. We then propose a novel\napproach, AIR-HLoc, which divides query images into different localisation\ndifficulty levels based on their similarity to the reference image database.
